Thanks to the Program Co-Chairs and the Industry Track Co-Chairs for their hard work during the submission period. Apologies for being quiet for so long. We now have a snapshot of the submission numbers. 

## Main Conference

We had notable jumps in submissions this year! The Program Co-Chairs are still working on numbers related to "desk rejects" &ndash; specifically, papers that were rejected without review due to author mistakes that are [mostly avoidable](https://naacl2018.wordpress.com/2017/12/24/reject-without-review-avoidable-mistakes/). It takes a little while to figure this out for such a large number of submissions, so please stay tuned for more details. 

The following are the number of submissions reported by the Program Co-Chairs. Note that these numbers _do not_ yet exclude desk rejects but _do_ exclude the 455 papers that were withdrawn.

| Type | Number |
|---------------------------| -----:| 
| **Long papers** | 1198 (compared to 647 in 2018) |
| **Short papers** | 757 (compared to 425 in 2018) |
| **Total submissions** | 1955 (compared to 1072 in 2018) | 


## Industry Track

The following are the numbers reported by the Industry Track Co-Chairs. Note that in this case the final submissions exclude _both_ withdrawn papers as well as desk rejects.

| Type | Number |
| ---- | ------:|
| **Abstracts submitted** | 124 | 
| **Papers withdrawn** | 11 |
| **Desk rejected (Incomplete)** | 11 | 
| **Desk rejected (Duplicates)** | 1 | 
| **Desk rejected (Page limit)** | 1 |
| **Total final submissions** | 100 (compared to 91 in 2018) |

Additionally, 17 papers were asked to fix formatting & anonymity issues before they could be reviewed. All made appropriate corrections.

Happy Holidays!
