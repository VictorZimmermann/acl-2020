We have also booked a small number of rooms specifically for students at the [Marriott Seattle Airport](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seawa-seattle-airport-marriott/) at the super-discounted rate of <b>$139</b>. We strongly encourage students to share rooms to the extent possible.

The ACL Office will accept your reservation request and make the reservations on your behalf. Room sharing is recommended since only a limited number of rooms are available at the discounted rates. If you would like to share, you will need to specify the total number of people who will be sharing the room including yourself (i.e., yourself plus 1 to 3 others). Please be aware that rooms typically come with two beds so any more than two people may have to share a bed.

The Marriott Seattle Airport is near the airport, and offers free shuttle to and from the hotel/airport.  The Marriott Hotel is also close to the Airport light rail, roughly a 10 minute walk, then taking you to the Hyatt Regency Hotel (conference venue).  Please be aware the light rail itself probably takes 30-45 minutes, so there would be a commute each way.

## Welcome Reception

A Welcome Reception will be held on Sunday, July 5th from 6:00pm to 8:00pm.

Join us in the Columbia Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel (the conference venue) where you can meet and make new friends and catch up with your colleagues. Light food and refreshments will be served.

The ACL 2020 Social Event will be held on Tuesday, July 7th, from 7:30 pm to 11:00 pm at MoPoP.

The Museum of Pop Culture’s mission is to make creative expression a life-changing force by offering experiences that inspire and connect our communities. Join us for food, drinks, and a fun experience!  To peak your interest and provide a wonderful time this evening, we have arranged all of the spaces within MoPop to be open to us.

Find your way around a one-of-a-kind building and check out the current exhibitions [here](https://www.mopop.org/exhibitions-plus-events/exhibitions/).

There will be two different areas offering a variety of food and beverage stations so, if there is a long line in one area, visit another area and come back to the first area when less busy.  The two areas will have different foods and both areas will offer vegetarian, vegan, etc. as well as meat or fish dishes.

To get to the event, catch the historic Seattle Center Monorail, built in 1962 for the Seattle World’s Fair.  Walk about .2 mile to the Westlake Station to catch the monorail, which runs every 6 minutes and will take 8 minutes to get to MoPop.  The cost is $2.50 for the ticket.

One entrance ticket will be included with each main conference registration. We may have a few extra tickets for sale for accompanying persons so, if you are interested, stop by the registration desk when there are no lines.

## Visa Information

The following questions will help you in determining whether and how to apply for a U.S. visa to attend the conference.

**Can I travel to the U.S. without a visa?**

Please see [this page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) to determine whether you are eligible to apply for an [Electronic System Travel Authorization (ESTA)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/) instead, which might be cheaper and easier.  This is usually allowed if you hold a passport from a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, but there are some exceptions.  Be sure to apply for the ESTA at least 72 hours in advance.  [_Do not_](https://visaguide.world/tips/how-to-avoid-esta-fraud/) purchase your ESTA from any website other than the one linked above.

**What kind of visa do I need?**

To attend the conference, you should apply for a nonimmigrant B-1 visa.  (This also [permits](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/B-1%20permissible%20activities.pdf) you to engage in tourism during your trip.)

**How do I apply for a visa?**

Please apply well in advance.  Visa applications can take from 1&ndash;4 months to be approved and normally require an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  For details, begin [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) and navigate to the website for the embassy or consulate nearest you for further visa instructions.

**How much will it cost?**

The non-refundable visa application fee is [approximately $160](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/fees-visa-services.html#temp) in local currency.  Depending on your nationality, you may also have to pay a [visa issuance fee](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html).

**Why should I request a visa invitation letter?**

A letter is not specifically required.  However, you are supposed to [bring documentation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) to your visa interview.  Bringing a letter from the conference organizers can help to establish the purpose of your trip: for example, we can document that you are coming to present a paper.  You can request such a letter [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WY4w_ivCkJNKnHxP2pxjk6pUMVg1UDM3RjFDU0tRU1dUSTlGVzNRTVhIQS4u).

In addition, if you have already paid for your registration, bringing your receipt can help to establish your ability to pay.  In some countries, it may also be wise to bring a letter from your own institution that authorizes you to attend the conference.

**What other documents may be needed in the visa interview?**

The answer to this question varies by the country where the interview is conducted, and perhaps also by your nationality.  Typically you will be asked to bring:
- your visa interview appointment letter
- [suitable](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html) photos or digital images
- your passport, valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of stay in the U.S.
- DS-160 application confirmation page
- application fee payment receipt

You may also bring other documentation that will help you answer the interviewer’s questions.  The interviewer is particularly interested to establish:
- The purpose of your trip.  See the previous question.  You may also be asked to bring your CV.
- Your intent to depart the United States after your trip.  You may wish to show your return ticket, and evidence of your work and family responsibilities outside the U.S.
- Your ability to pay all costs of the trip.  You may wish to show your bank statement, or evidence of travel grants or sponsorships, etc.
- Your U.S. stay address.  You may wish to bring your hotel booking information.

**Is it safe to go ahead and register for the conference before I have a visa?**

Yes. If your visa application is denied, you are entitled to [request](mailto:office@aclweb.org) a full refund of your conference registration fees.
