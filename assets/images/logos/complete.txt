One small anomaly: although the TV was HDTV able, the channels had only analog quality.
Furthermore the location of the hotel is great.
Only a couple of blocks to the BART, Muni and Cable Car station Powell St, as well as the large Westfield shopping center.
Union square is only two blocks away and another great place for shopping.
WIFI is free if you register for the loyalty program of the Kimpton Group.
A restaurant is attached to the hotel but there are numerous other places to eat nearby as well.
Overall I definitely can recommend this hotel as it is centrally located, has nice clean rooms and friendly employees.

Stayed at Hotel Britannique for 4 nights.
Great Hotel, lovely room with very comfortable bed.
Fabulous breakfast, which we needed as we set off on foot each morning for our trips around Paris.
Wonderful location, as all major sites within walking distance.
Discovered a wonderful Restaurant called BAM - Bar A Manger, just around the corner with Cheesecake to die for!!
Will definately return to this Hotel on my next trip to Paris.

Everthing was perfect...it was quiet, staff was top drawer, housekeeping was immaculate, and every need was anticipated and met.
I spent much of my life as a "road warrior" and tend to be quite critical of hotels.
I couldn't even find a single complaint about this property...unusual for me!
A couple of things that will help other travellers to enjoy their stay.
First, ask for a room on the back.
Second, be prepared to do some u-turns to get into and out of the property, dependent on direction of travel.
Restaurants are nearby, many and varied, and all within walking distrance.

I chose to stay after reading reviews on this website and also from the great comminication via email from the manager.
Not speaking any french, we never had a probblem with the staff.
There is a fantastic supermarket about 5 minutes down the road and an amazing bakery right across the street with the best croissants ever!!
We were happy not being in the absolute thick of things and found that the Metro could get us everywhere we needed to go with minimum fuss.
There are a couple of stops near by.

The attempts to be "trendy" were silly.

I stayed there last year in a 2 bedroom suite (2 bathrooms) with my wife, 2 daughters, and 2 grand-daughters.
Was perfect for us - other wise we would have to book two rooms.
Also, having a full kitchen was great with little ones.
The room itself was very good value - however, if you need internet and parking it really adds up.
The valet parking was $35 per night then you have the tips to pick up and drop off your vehicle.
The overall service was 100%.
For those who say it was not a 5 star I am guessing they didn't pay 5 star rates.

If you're looking for a place to stay in Vegas near the strip but family friendly (no casino inside) this is a good choice.
It's a time share that is rented out on a daily, weekly basis.

Rooms are large and beds are comfy.
Negatives include: dreadfully thin walls.
(I could hear our neighbors taking the silverware from the drawer and every conversation as if they were in my room.)
Also, the only dining option is a 'snack bar' that leaves one seeking alternatives off premises.

Maria and David from the lobby bar and thanks to Erika and everyone at the front desk.

I chose the Hilton Financial District because I'm a Hilton Diamond member and the hotel is right across the street from my business appointment.

This is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in -- at $500 per night I certainly would have expected more.
All of the four-star hotels in New York where I usually stay were booked solid.

I prefer suites so that I can bring in a few groceries and make some of my own meals.

I thought all suites were suites, and some with a decent kitchen.

Considering that for two people that's almost as much as you would pay for a hostel, I was quite impressed.
The hotel is really modern and has this great sleek black and white striped theme.
The staff was very welcoming and even allowed us to pay early due to some credit card issues.
Upon booking I had requested a room with a balcony and that's what we got.
It looked out onto this large street, not too noisy and with a sun screen so it wasn't too bright in the morning.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there.
Also easily accessible to the metro and free wifi.

The reception staff, were all very welcoming and charming - any request was met with a smile and prompt response.
We stayed in a luxurious room, generously sized with a great marble tiled bathroom and very opulent.
The view from our room was of a wall but did not hinder our stay as this is common of most accomodations in Venice.
The breakfast (included) was as fine as you'll find in a European hotel, although advertised as an American breakfast?

I travel weekly to different destinations across the United States and she was the best I have seen in 5 years of travel.
She went out of her way to be sure I understood the different menu options and checked on me regularly.
She also noticed that I was in "work mode" and asked if I would like to take coffee with me as I left.
This would not be a normal thing to consider at the dinner hour but she noticed!

The rooms were extremely small but clean and the hotel demanded payment in advance, which I found to be a little strange.
Considering our situation though, we were happy to have a room.

It is a good business hotel with very good service in all areas: front desk, conference facilities, door people.
The room was spacial, offered nice business desk.
Internet did work.
The view from the 11th floor room was not great, but one does not have to spend time looking through the windows all the time.
A few nice eating establishments can be found at walking distance from the hotel.
The railway station with a small shopping area is not far away, however a bit uphill.

The room was nice and spacious with a good view of the water and Grant Park.
Nice large bathroom with seperate shower and bathtub.

The problem we had was the room wouldn't get cool (even with the ac blasting all afternoon).
I had a repair person come in to check it out and they did, but said they couldn't get it any lower than it is.

And it's in walking distance of everything.
Really no need to use the public transport if you like walking.
Going to the Centraal Station takes 30 minutes (when carrying a very heavy suitcase so probably less is your hands are free!).
The only thing I guess is the lack of pressure in the shower.
But I guess that's to be expected in an old house and it's also a bit tricky to adjust to proper water temperature.

My only complaint with the hotel was the elevator leading to the parking garage.
It is very outdated (80's) and makes you feel like you are going to get trapped in it every time.
On a couple of occasions I would enter it, the door would close, and it would do nothing.
Took several times to get it to move.
On another occasion, it got to the Lobby level and the doors rattled for over a minute before finally opening.
If you self-park, riding it is your only option, since there are no stairs.
I think it is their way of convincing you to pay the extra $$ to valet.

I stayed here during a business convention.
Hotel is just a few blocks from the convention center.
It's a very nice facility, and I had a lovely one bedroom suite, with a huge bathroom, balcony, and fireplace.
There is a small work out room, but no pool.
Breakfast was excellent.
The staff were all very helpful and polite.
Be warned, it is a fairly long walk to the Market and downtown areas.

While the next three days, it did get progressively better, I honestly do not believe it was a boiler problem.
My room was the last corner room on the second floor.
I just think being an old building; it just had poor water pressure.
You turn on the hot water for about 5 minutes, it eventually comes though not very strong.
The other problem was internet access.
While each room had free Ethernet jack access, for whatever reason, it stopped working after using it for about an hour on our first day.
No one was ever able to figure out the problem.

Unfortunately when we stayed there was major road works on Stewart Street - steam rollers @ 3am.
Not the hotels fault at all - but Camomile tea and ear plugs weren't the answer - scotch would have been better.

Red Fin was delicious and had great mood lighting.

Obviously there was ot much that anyone could do, since the heating system seems to be automatic.
Even though there was a sign that said not to open the window, we did anyway.
Unfortunately this did not help the temperature of the room.
I'm not sure what the answer to the problem was.
The morning breakfast was quite adequate and the location could not be beat.
Maybe if it is cold outside itwould not be a problem.
I should have tried plugging in the air conditioning unit to see if that would have cooled off the room.

I could only assume that the grille in the bathroom was for supply air from the heating/AC unit which means that air blows into the bathroom.

Lovely well resostored historic inn,carefully preserved with great taste.

I was not able to get hot water from the tap.
After fiddling around with the knobs below the sink I was finally able to get hot water after waiting about a minute.
When I took my shower in the morning the water temperature did fluctuate a bit.
Also, and this is unfortunately the reason I will probably not return, the hairdryer was painfully weak.
Normally I can dry my hair in five minutes.
It took me twenty minutes before my hair was finally dry!
Also, the $10.00 self-parking rate, we felt, was a bit too high.

We opened the door to the room to be smacked in the face with a very pungent smell of damp.
Therefore, we insisted on moving to the Tower rooms (an extra $16 per room a night!!!).
Couldn't really find a fault with the rest of our 2 week stay.
The rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels were left daily.
Staff were very pleasant.
The hotel restaurant was good, but wouldn't recommend getting the breakfast buffet for $9.95.

After all, the majority of us were getting away from husbands and children for the weekend before school started.
The hotel did accomodate us by finding adjoining rooms for us so that was a plus in the beginning.
Our disappointment started when we arrived up in our room.
During our 4 day stay at the hotel, the air conditioner was not working properly.
The thermometer said 68 degrees, but it was more like 78 degrees!
Sleeping at night was extremly uncomfortable due to no air.

From the minute we arrived at the hotel, we were given the upmost courtesy, care, and concern.
The entire staff was very accomodating and so helpful.
They took care of all our need's so much, that we could just concentrate on the crisis at hand & not worry about anything else.
It is hard to mention just a few name's, since everyone was so kind & good at their job.
We had so much fun with the restaurant staff, which gave us a little down time from our problem's at hand.
All the staff behind the desk, in the lounge, on the floor in general, were the best people & so kind.

This makes it a little hard to see out, especially for those of us who enjoy the views.
The casino also appears to have a scent of pina colada throughout.

It had a desk so I could work and a couch for relaxing at night.
The staff was REALLY, REALLY nice.
Everytime we walked past a staff member they made sure to smile and say hello.
The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.
The only thing that was wrong was the loose cable on the back of our TV which had to be jiggled every so often.
No big deal.

The decor of this hotel, and any other Kimpton is really nice, and elegant.
The rooms were exceptionally clean, and well taken care of.
My only slight complaint I have about this hotel was how thin the walls were.
You could hear the whole conversation going on in the room next to us.
They were talking at a normal voice level, yet could still hear every word.
Luckily they weren't rowdy and went to bed about the same time we did.
Otherwise I highly highly recommend this hotel to anyone!

There were 2 barking dogs that the management refused to acknowledge.
Finally, they told us they would talk to the owners so they could "talk to the dogs" to get them to be quiet.
We then changed rooms.
But, unknown to us, there was a confrence of 2000 college students who took over the hotel from Wednesday to Saturday.
They occupied the lounge that we paid extra to use.
They sat on the floor of the 15th floor having meetings.

The pool was never too crowded.
The other one at the southern most on the beach was very crowded.
Didn't get to enjoy the beach cafe, because it was the world cup finals so it was disgustingly crowded.

We went sailing one morning, and that was quite enjoyable.
A refundable deposit was required.
It's a good idea to make a reservation.
They do have staff to sail with you if necessary--for a fee.

wonderful help when in need This resort is so beautiful!
My husband and I love to read on the beach, listen and watch the waves, this was a perfect spot.
Food, drinks, grounds, midnight couple massage, room, and new friends met were the absolute best.
My main comment will be on the hotel and Apple Vacation staff during a tough time for me.
Three days after our arrival I found out that my mother had been admitted to the hospital with the flu.

We joked that it added character and age to the place.
Our room size was fine, not what I would consider generous by any means, but we're not running into walls either.
I don't think the furniture is that old, they're just banged up by previous guests.
The only thing I wished to be better was the tiny old TV is placed so low.
I had to sit at the foot of the bed just to watch it.
The old walnut painted refrigerator below the TV leaked some moisture/dampness into the carpet but it didn't have any mushroom odor or anything.

The pool and jacuzzi were very small considering that there are so many many guest rooms in this hotel.
Buffet breakfast was also average.
The hotel is situated at River Valley with no easy access to any MRT stations.
Only buses and taxis.
I will not advise tourists who are not familiar with Singapore to stay here.
There are definitely better hotels in town with similar pricing.
Furthermore, the service is also slow.

OK, this may stray from the average experience at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

I arrived on Saturday around 9pm.
They didn't have the room I requested so I got "upgraded" to a bay front room.
Which meant a view of the pool and the building across from me, not the bay.
To tell you the truth, I didn't particularly care one way or the other because I was leaving by 11:30am.
So I get settled in and begin to change for a night out on the town.
I immedietly notice that the bathroom trash can had bandaids,wadded up tissues and other things in it.

My husband and I stayed for a week at the Sandos Caracol.
It was an ok room, had a nice beach and there were lots of things to do.
We decided to take the bait for the 45 minute sales pitch.
That lasted 3 hours and was the typical merry-go-round of sales people pressuring us to buy time there.
We won't make that mistake again - ever.
Another mistake we will never make is to use a credit card for anything down there.
We bought tickets for Xcaret at the booth in the Sandos Caracol lobby and ended up having our credit card number stolen.

The staff responded very quickly to the tub and toilet problems as well.
Overall, we had an enjoyable stay there because the food in their cafeteria style restaurant was great and the pool was warm and very clean.
They offer live entertainment on certain nights and their frozen drinks were great!

But, we were on vacation and had saved up extra cash so we didn't really mind.
Though, I'd rather not spend $20 for a simple ceral breakfast again!
Universal Studios was the main event for us, and it was FAB!
Harry Potter World was AMAZING--make sure you get a butter beer.
Staying "on-site" was even better because we got fast-passes for most rides.
The longest we ever waited for a ride was probably 15 mins, something I'm so glad we paid for!

The lobby has a nice fireplace with seating.

On the negative side, the room was very small and in need of an update.

The shower has only a little half-glass panel so when we took a shower the water went all over the bathroom.

Is our advice, we arrived in Sydney with no reservation and the place was CHOCABLOCK!
We could not find a decent room at a decent price for love nor money!
Out of desperation we stayed at the Highfield Hotel.
It was ropey, strange, lacklustre, old, dated and not 100% clean.
But we grinned and beared it and used the free wifi, and got ourselves booked the following day at a hostel down the road.

Overpriced.
For the cost of our stay (about $220 per night, plus tax), I expected much more from this old girl.
Unfortunately, some time ago (maybe the 1970s?)
the resort built ALOT of condos several long blocks from the main hotel.
The units are very small and not particularly inviting, and they're all crowded together.
Sort of like a big, low-end apartment complex.

It's more like a man-made lagoon.
It's not a long stretch of sandy beach like in Playa del Carmen or in Cancun.
Just think of it like a salt water swimming pool with lots of fish.

Yes, a few of the rooms and suites, even in the private Towers, could use a refresh.
And, yes, the cost of a simple breakfast for two can set you back well over $100.

The beach has suffered some damage and the sand bags are an eyesore.
However, the service at the beach and pool area combined with the overall beauty of the place more than compensates.
There is some noise from surrounding resorts and this may be an issue for light sleepers and people that want total peace and quiet.
It is not "offensive" - you just hear music from the neighbouring resorts at night depending on where you stay .
Food - the restaurants are outstanding .

Do ask about the controls for heating the room as we didn't and couldn't switch off during the night.

Nearby are many restaurants, all looks good, too bad, we have no time to try them all.
However, already decided if I come back Singapore in the future, I'll stay here again.
Only drawback I'd have about here, is that they don't have elevators for all buildings.
To my understanding, some rooms can have elevator access but my wing has no elevator access.
Free Wi-Fi in room, that's quite fast and perfect.
Small room but OK.
I like that they have cleaning faucet for toilet too!

The bed and especially the pillows were extremely comfortable.
The TV was located in an armoire and provided a good choice of channels.
The hotel has 6 elevators, which means that guests never have to wait long when either ascending to the rooms or descending to the lobby.
A very big plus in my book.
The location of the hotel in Stockton Street is ideal.
Market Street is a short walk away and leads the dedicated shopper past numerous department stores.

I advise buyer beware when considering this hotel.
The rooms are very small, poorly furnished, and without adequate lighting.
Most rooms have no natural light.
Security is not adequate and do not meet minimal standards.
I love Chicago, and have stayed at much nicer 3 star hotels for the same price.
Chatting with others in the elevator only confirmed this is a general impression.
I spent very little time in the hotel, and will never stay there again.

My husband booked this hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary.
we were not disappointed - it's a gorgeous quiet hotel just 5 minutes walk from Tour Eiffel and Arc De Triomphe.
our room was the same as the one they show on their website.
We arrived to rose petals, tea and coffee making facilities, and macarrons.
The bed was turned down every night and chocolates left on it.
the room had lovely big windows, nice timber flooring and a nice crisp feel to it.

I am glad I did not read the other reviews before staying or I would have been scared away.
I took my 5 year old to the beach and we stayed at the Bermuda House.
I checked the room out first (827).
Everything was new.
New carpet, kitchen apliances, bathroom, beds, sheets and beding very clean.
Great view of the Ocean from the balcony and intercoastal from the front.
The toilet need to be flushed twice after use and the balcony was small but overall a great bargin.

The location was ok depending on what your looking for.
It is on Smather's beach which it nice but too far to walk to Duval Street and all of the action.
It was a great hotel and would absolutly reccomend it to a friend.
The only down side was the "free shuttle" It was a joke.
The shuttle need to be reserved in the morning but everymorning it was all full by 10 am!

I was staying at the Cooper Square Hotel in Noho for a few days prior to the St. Regis due to my friends party.
I wanted to try out Peter Luger's but the concierge there couldn't get me in.
So I figured try the St. Regis and they did manage to get me a reservation even though I was staying at another hotel.
They also recommended a resturant called Blue Hill and made us a reservation which I noted was most likely very coveted.
The place was packed with people waiting.
The food was to die for!!
Standing ovation to the concierge at the St.

We decieded not to complain about that also.
We figured the had the hot water heater set for safety regulations.
My only other minor complaint would be to close of the shower and sink area some how in the master bath.
It was great being able to eat 2 meals a day at the condo and it was relaxing and felt like home.
Someone on a review said the internet service was terriable we actually had no problems with it and with a 14 year old that was very important.
I was not sure I would like not having maid service but it was actually quite nice not having someone enter our room every day.

It is perfectly located.
A ten minute walk (with luggage on wheels) to the Termini station.
No need to take a taxi upon arrival at the airport.
Just hop on a train (11 euros) and walk to the hotel.
Across the street from the hotel there are 2-3 restaurants and a pharmacy.

Our room was small, but very adequate.
It was clean, and the 42 inch plasma gave it a feel of a much more expensive room.
The only down side was that it was pretty loud.

The best part of the hotel is it's location right across the street from the beach.
We loved that we could just walk right out to the beach at anytime day or night.
Since we had 5 kids with us, it was nice that the McDonald's was just a few steps away as well.
Also, the proximity to some great restaurants, such as Cheeseburgers in Paradise and Duke's Canoe Club, was an added plus.
The bathrooms were clean but kind of old.

We have stayed at most all of the Marriotts in Las Vegas and this by far is the favorite.
The pool is wondeful.
It has a shallow area that is great for infants and toddlers.
It is about 12 miles off the strip west of town but it is very quiet.
If you want to visit a casino it is a short walk to the Rampart or drive to the Suncoast .
There are plenty of dining options as well.

We found a stain and asked if they can change it.
She said that it is clean and that they only change sheets like every 2 days (for conservation purposes).
She talks too much and insisted that if there is a stain she is pretty sure that it is not blood.
I guess all she needs to do is check it, and change it.

I called several places around Orlando area for a one night stay and everyone were dry humor.
I reached Dee Dee on my last call and it was a pleasure talking with her.
My wife and i booked just because of her.
The rooms were normal size, nicely furnished with granite and affordable.
the breakfast was wonderful ( waffles, bagels,fruit,coffee,cereals etc.).
The rooms were clean.
My wife and I two weekends prior were at a upscale resort in Atlanta Ga ( Crown Plaza ) and the rooms in Orlando by far were superior.

After reading the reviews on this forum I was worried about what I would find.
Yes the hotel is old, but it is well maintained.
The bathrooms as mentioned in other posts are small.
The rooms are on the smallish side too but if you are like us you are not in Chicago to stay in a hotel room.
The beds were comfortable and things were clean.
The location is great!

Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel in downtown Chicago to visit the Art Institute of Chicago museum.
Very convenient location - we could walk to the museum easily in a few minutes although it was a bit chilly and snowy.
We all liked the interesting architecture of the hotel and rooms.
Breakfast was the usual Hampton hot and cold foods, and was fine.
Room design was more interesting than the usual hotel decor, and we enjoyed it.
Staff were helpful when needed.
The one drawback is the high price of parking, which is available via valet service ($42/day+tips).

After thoroughly reviewing this hotel via their website and Tripadvisor.com as well, I decided to give it a try.
I am a frequent traveler to the French Quarter and I do know my way around.
My experience with the reservations agent was fine, was impressed with the check-in process and the valet staff who assisted me with my truck.
The room was clean and my wish for a room over-looking Conti was honored.
I was awoken at approximately 3am by the noise coming from Bourbon Street, but hey, it is NOLA after all.
My only concern is that this hotel still uses the age-old key-lock for the room doors.
This can be a security issue if there is an unscrupulous staffer or an errant key left around.

It is a city bus that can take you where ever you need to go.
You can get a pass for 24hours for only $7.
That is great being that a cab will cost you double that price or more depending on where you are going.
Catch The Deuce to target which is similar to a super Walmart.
You can buy things there that are much cheaper than what the hotel will charge you.
Ballys is in a great location.

The bath is very small and basic.

It's an old apartment building turned hotel so the space is far more generous than any Michigan Avenue hotel.

There was also a few places we went to a few times in that area.
One restaurant that we like was called the Ecole Militaire, obviously name for the Ecole Militaire right across the street.
It was tasty.
There was also a nearby, late night bar that we got to know one of the bartenders.

Again if you want a huge casino stay in the USA.
It was a decent casino.
The shops and such are reasonable.
Except the cigar shop!!!
DO NOT PAY THE RIDICULOUS PRICES IN THE CIGAR SHOP.
I noted that for Cuban's or ANY other cigar the prices are literally 4-5 times retail cost.
Not sure why but I was in shock.

So in conclusion, the hotel is amazing.
Despite my Japanese breakfast not being the greatest, I would still definitely stay here again.
This location is a little towards the end of the strip but still within range if you're looking to party.

It is a tiny sensor light (grain of rice) and if flashes approximately every 20 seconds, if you blink you would miss it.
In fact I would never have noticed it if I hadn't deliberately looked for it.
The breakfast was excellent.
In fact I have stayed in many hotels and have not had such a selection to choose from.
Something for everyone.
The only disappointment was the pool was shut .
Would definitely use this hotel again as very handy for the metro also.

Its near the Buca restaurant and is walking distance to Horton Plaza mall, the bars & restaurants and shopping in the French Quarter.

I live in Dallas but stayed overnight at this hotel one night with a friend in town for a dog show next door at Market Hall.
If you have a convention or event there, this hotel is perfect because it shares a parking lot and you can just walk across the lot.
They also were offering very discounted rates for the dog show.
The hotel room itself looked like it had been recently renovated with new furniture and carpet.
Everything was clean.

Free coffee/juice and newspaper in the morning as a room service was nice.

The pool is small and outdoor and has saline water.
If you go there in the evening, after the sunlight has gone from the pool, it can be very windy.

There was free internet access on a lobby computer and there was free access in all the guest rooms.
We took advantage of the minibar (something that we rarely do) and the prices were very reasonable.

The Golden Nugget's buffet is my favorite.

Some of them have been remodeled and are very nice.
The others are older but are still a great deal.

Some additional pointers: the location is on the west side of Toronto, meaning that it is in the entertainment district.

We were awoken by the duty manager advising that a leak had been reported and we needed to change rooms.
We were upgraded to a Premium room for the duration of our stay for the inconvenience.
We had an excellent view from the 16th floor of the Marina and The Marina Bay Sands.The staff were very pleasant and courteous.
We did not use any of the restuarants as there are numerous places to eat and drink in Singapore.
We though a nice and different touch was the birdsong in the morning.
The hotel put 4 or 5 caged birds out and can be heard throughout the hotel.

I have stayed at Hotel Emmaus a half a dozen times from 2000 until this year.
It is a wonderful place to stay in Rome as it is right off St. Peter's Square.

It is truly an Italian hotel.
It is not a Marriott, if you are looking for that, stay in the USA.

Over the years, we have always had confidence in Best Western hotels, which is why we chose to stay at this particular location.
We walked in the room and right away, there was a really weird smell.

But we were so tired and my partner was not feeling well, so we decided to stay anyway.
After being in the room for a while, I noticed that the coffee cups were stained with coffee.
It looked like they quickly wiped off the cup with a wrag, but missed a spot.

NEVER had to wait in line for a taxi (unlike at many other hotels).

Room We had two rooms, both on the 32nd floor.
Both were large for NYC, one especially so.
The bathrooms were a little small, but I didn't come to NYC to sit in the bath.
The decor was fine, and both rooms were clean and had great views out over Midtown.
The only downside was the placing of one of the rooms (the larger), which was directly across from the elevators.
This inevitably led to a fair amount of noise, but there was nothing excessive about it.

Our room was tiny, there was no room for luggage.
My husband suggested putting my suitcase in front of the door, which I knew would be a disaster in case of a fire.
The carpet was shabby, the room was dimly lit and my feeling was this must have been the wrong Hotel D'Inghliterra.
This hotel needs refurbishing badly.
Additionally, although we paid top dollar for our room in advance, it did not include breakfast.
On principle alone, we would not dine at their restaurant, so we went roaming for a pastry cafe for breakfast.
Do not stay at this hotel until they completely redecorate!

They have a luggage room to give you some wiggle room to do some things out in the city just before and after check in/out.
The room was ready hours before check in time.
The hotel is on West 32nd, in Koreatown, with a dozen great Korean restaurants doors away.
It is 5 or so minutes walk from Penn Station and every transport option you'd need.
All that being true, the room was uncomfortably hot all night, with no air flow and no adjustment possible.
I heard others complain at the desk.
They give minimal towels (one wash cloth for two people?)

A very average business hotel.
The location is good and is in the middle of down town singapore and very close to Raffles Hotel.
The reception area is very nice, the room itself was average - nothing wrong with it, just a bit plain and ordinary looking.
The internet wasn't included so you need to pay to use it.
The rooms were not so clean and it looks bit run down.
The hotel can be quite crowded since it's a crew hotel for many airlines.
Overall, an ok hotel for a quick stopover

Very nise little hotel in Sultanahmet (historical center of Istanbul).
Perfectly nice and clean rooms, good service, staff that speaks english very well.
If you need any information about Istanbul, you can ask at reception.
At first, location doesn't seem so good but once when you get familiar with streets nearby, it's perfect and also very quiet.
Aya Sofia and Blue Mosque are at 5 minutes walking distance.
Also there is tram station nearby, and by tram you can get to any point in Istanbul.

It is very trendy and modern.
I liked the brick exposure in the rooms.
Although the view out our window was bad because the building across has been demolished so it was an empty lot.
We had a large room with a couch and desk.
The wall would slide over to cover the TV and desk area.
There also was electric blinds that would come down to make the room extra dark.
The light switches were a little confusing and we still never really figured them out.

We had so much fun at the hotel and attractions that we can not wait to go back.
Like most places in Vegas on the strip, it is very expensive but well worth the splurge!
Also, if you can afford, upgrade to a Lakeside view, you will face the strip and fountains.
If you are looking to splurge on the hotel but want to save a few bucks dining / attractions, here are some ideas: 1.
Grab a free coupon book.
You will definitely get a lot of 2 for 1's there.

A bargan even after price fee of $13.00 for taxes and priceline fee.
However the hotel charges another $22.50 per night for a so called resort fee.
This increases the bid price of $50.00 by over 40% to $72.50 per night.
When you add in $13 price line fees this fbrings the room charge per night to over $85.00.
For the nights I was staying in Vegas that was not a bargain or even a fair price for the hotel.
Priceline does not disclose this fee except in the real small type even though they know about it.

We booked a concierge room at The Beach Club after finally making a decision between there and the Yacht Club.
Bad choice!
The room was very small and dark and our 'view' was of the shale roof below.
The wallpaper was dirty, the comforters were old and faded and the beds desperately need replacing.
I really don't feel it deserves to be classed as a deluxe.
If you are thinking concierge will be a nice treat, please think again.

We had been to Phoenix several times before and had always stayed in Scottsdale ..
Since we had our teenage son with us we decided to stay here because of the water park.
The water park is indeed great and makes staying here worthwhile when everything is working which is not always the case.

The entire City Center complex looks like office buildings.
Arriving at the Aria is like valeting your car at some corporate office or at the towers in Century City (Los Angeles).

Inside the casino is dark and difficult to navigate.

I am on a 10-day business trip - London, Paris, Dublin, Istanbul.
Four nights at the K&K, my first time in Paris.
A lovely hotel with polite, attentive staff who exhibit great patience as I try to recall my French.
Room service is adequate and the location is wonderful.
I did a 7 km stroll this evening to the Eiffel Tower and past several landmarks.
The room is small (of course), but clean, bright, and warm.
The bed is comfortable enough with good pillows.

The staff were very helpful and the room was a nice size and beds were comfortable.
The public areas were very nice also--breakfast room, sitting room, lounge and outside eating area.
We did the summer promotion like others have mentioned and really enjoyed the nice, relaxing breakfast before our hectic fast paced tourist schedule took us away.
The Rue de Buci was just a few blocks away and was a favorite spot to walk to for cafe life.
We walked to everything from this spot and really only used the metro to arrive and depart.
I can't stop thinking about our trip!

The hotel is also near iTrip stop 21 which means you can easily get to Seaworld and Aquatica.
We didn't go to Disney so I can't comment on how close the hotel is to there.
The breakfast was fair for the price of our stay.
Nothing fantastic but its free - we would of appreciated bacon on a few more mornings!
The Monday to Thursday evening 5 to 7 food can be hit and miss but its also free so its not like you can complain.
Its nice to be handed a free hot dog and beer if you're back between 5 and 7.

Not all rooms are renovated, however, so be sure to request one when booking or checking in.
Our room keys never worked for the first TWO (of the seven) days we had booked.
We literally had to call security every time we returned to our room -- and they had some trouble getting in as well.
When, after they claimed to have replaced the lock on the second day, and our keys STILL didn't work, I made some noise.
Long story short, we were upgraded to a gorgeous Central Park view room on the 41st floor for our remaining five days in NYC.

They did have a very small closet that you could hang a few pieces of clothing.

There are no towel bars to hang your wet towles on so you have to drape them all over the room.
They are no holders for the tissue paper so you have to worry about it getting wet in the minascule bathroom.

He really went out of his way to accomodate my family for breakfast even making a decaf pot of coffee upon request.
He made us feel like we were at a resort rather than a hotel.
Kudos to him.
Negative- wireless internet signal reception in our room was very weak indeed.
Our room was on the top floor in the corner of the building, so I'm sure it had a lot to do with it.
Most hotels have wireless routers on every floor to improve reception.

My girlfriend and I decided to spend our birthdays in San Diego this year and we decided on the Pacific Terrace Hotel for a couple of nights.
When we arrived we were greeted friendly and professionally.
We were a little early, but we were able to get our room right away.
We rented the Ocean View Jr. King Suite, and all I can say is WOW.
First off the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our birthdays (the wine was excellent).
I also called the hotel the day before to order roses for my girlfriend's birthday and the hotel took my order promptly.

We stayed at the Montana Hotel in London in June 2008, LOVED IT!
The value is terrific for London Hotels.
The location is fantastic, you are close to the "tube" to bus routes and there are many stores, banks, etc.

The closer you get to the harbor, the more the parking will cost you.
Great freeway access to visit the local attractions.
The little Italy section of town is only 4 blocks down the street toward the harbor with fabulous dining options.
And the harbor is only another 4 blocks past that.

My husband and I sat at dinner one night counting who left tips- 1 out of 6 tables.
REALLY????
if you could afford to go on vacation, you could afford an extra $5 a night for your hard working waiter.
It makes their day and it's worth every penny.
It really breaks my heart that people don't care enough to leave a little something for them.
And cleaning service too

Just keep in mind they have a lot of cleaning service.

Convenient to BCEC via access road, avoiding South Boston Mess.
Shuttle charge instituted after reservation made, no exception made for fee, boss was pissed.
This was the original deal maker on pricing versus others with BCEC parking costs.
Hotel next to shopping center and two chain restaurants ,so no journeys into unfamiliar territory needed to eat or buy last minute supplies.
Free HIE breakfast good, enough protein for low carb dieters, decent cup of coffee too, 24 hrs.
Boss liked free cookies at night.
Internet service dependable, cell phones (Verizon & AT&T) worked well there.

Secondly, the entire hotel is very old, the corridor are hideous, the rooms are old.
It's just totally uncomfortable and unwelcoming.
Lastly when I tried to connect to the internet (which is included in my business plan), it did not work!
I called up front desk to transferred me to tech support which put me on hold for ages and ended up not solving the problem.
Internet is basic for anyone staying for business.
There are many hotels better with similar price in Montreal.

Even though they say Soho, its really Chinatown.
I had business at Federal Plaza, so its about as convenient as can be for business travel to that area.
I was early for check in, but they accomodated me and were very friendly.
Everyone was uniformly friendly, from the the guys at the front door, to the front desk staff, to the maids, to the bartenders.
The rooms are small, and at $279.00 (all taxes included) not necessarily a great bargain, but it could be worse.
I don't really know the rates in NYC.

There were Deluxe, Classic, and Executive rooms available for a three-night stay starting December 30.
That was something of a disappointment.
I cannot imagine that any of those rooms would not have been an upgrade over room 134.

We could hear noises in the hallway, from the room above us, and from the heater.
Also, the towels were ridiculously low quality for a hotel that is part of Starwood's Luxury Collection.

We stayed for 2 nights pre-cruise, on a Saturday and Sunday.
We chose Da House for the mostly good reviews and the ideal location, as well as the price.
We were forewarned about the noise - they are very honest about that.
We were not disappointed!!
On Saturday night we got very little sleep.
We chose Room 402 because it was advertised as "mostly quiet".
I'm sure it usually is, however the party that night was on the roof!

I'd definitely stay there again without hesitation.
When I left to travel Florence, it was only a 10 minute vaporetto ride to the train station.

The advertisements are a bit deceptive.
Chairs gone by 9.
-Questionable security.
In the hotel booklet they tell you the pizza ads people are sticking into your doors are from bad vendors.

Our room was comfortable, clean and enjoyable.
When you arrived or left the service was very good.
It was all lovely EXCEPT it had none of the charm of Boston.
Even though it was convenient to the convention center which is why we were in Boston that is the only thing it is convenient to.
The hotel will tell you there are restaurants nearby and they are some but there is very little foot traffic around the hotel especially at night.

Hotel room 1 was a 1980's cheap motel room that smelled and that we couldn't stay in because the tub was being fixed.

A quite new hotel at a great location.
It is centrally suited and in short distance to several main attractions.
Our room was lovely and functional with a comfortable bed.
The internet wifi was free and signal was trong.
Although the buffet breakfast was not included in the rate (6.50 Euros) but it was very good.
There was not a restaurant in the hotel, but thanks for it’s great location, there were many restaurants and fast food shop just around.
We can have something to enjoy at anytime.

We found this hotel to be dirty - carpet needed cleaning, less-than-fresh smelling, and just generally unkept.
I absolutely would not spend another evening here.
This hotel needs updating and more care to at least keeping the rooms (and halls) clean.
First clue should have been the lack of lighting in the parking lot, and filthy entry way.
Another big clue - I estimate only 10 rooms were being used - judging by the lack of lights.
At first, we weren't even sure the place was open.
I'd choose the new Quality Inn nearby.

Great Location Stayed two nights 2nd week of May, 2004.
Half block from Doumo, perfect location for all activities in Florence.
Hotel rates posted by TripAdvisor are out of date.
Double room, 190 Euro.
Rooms have been remodeled, spacious for Italy including bath with shower only.
A 7:00 AM wake-up call is not required because the Doumo's bells peal loudly one half block away.
Staff attentive, but not warm, probably due to some not having good command of English.

Staff is very friendly and their English is adequate.
Every evening they have a ceremony down in the lobby showing some candle lightening up and Taiji show.
However, the main corridor of the lobby is under construction and I suppose the ceremony should be better with a nice corridor.
We used buffet in the restaurant in the 1st floor and found it is very busy in lunch time.
We have to wait for a while to be seated when we tried to have a quick lunch there.

I stayed in JJ several times already and in all those time i did not expect a lot so whatever came my way, I was pleasantly surprised.
Except this one time when i left an electronic item in the room when i checked out.
I came straight from the hotel to the airport and then to my place in Jakarta.
The moment I unpacked I noticed that i did forget something.
I called JJ right away and the staff seemed unhelpful and nonchalant.
He told me to call back in 20 minutes and after that he said that no one found anything, which I found rather unbelievable.
To think that piece of electronic is only one part of another piece, it would be useless without the other.

Having read the reviews our main concern was that it would be a long way from the Strip.
However, at a reasonably brisk pace Ballys, which is mid way on the strip was a 10-15 minute walk.
From here, the main resorts were mostly within a 15 minute walk.
Ideal if you want a walk home after the huge American portions of food.
Rooms are a little dark and the air conditioner slightly noisy but other than that they were great.
Two huge double beds and a large sofa bed which we requested.

The value is great if you can score a room with the view out to Elliot Bay.
Just beautiful.
You dont need any more than the minimal ACe white decor with a view like this.
Also enjoyed room with large glass shower also (no view).

the carpets and bedspreads can certainly use an update but the room was clean and comfortable.
The only real drawback is the thin walls and creaky floorboards.
This wouldn't have been a huge irritation but the people next door were screamers and banging on doors.
The other drawback is that while there is wifi in the building you have to pay additional for it.
Also, there was a communal computer mentioned on their website which doesn't actually exist.
The continental breakfast left a lot to be desired but is pretty standard on what you get in similar hotels.

The two room suite was in good shape but the carpet was old and worn.
The best thing about our suite was that we could be together but yet have lots of space that ensured our privacy as well.
The walk to the strip was easy and I always felt safe.
I think if we would have been there any longer than the 3 nights the walk would have become tiresome.
And if you want the ability to just stop into your room to have a drink or change your clothes you have to walk all the way back.

Activites golare if you can't find something to do during the day you are a bore.
The rooms are OK, not great, but sufficient being as you don't spend much time there.
We slept well so that is all that really matters.
There is not much night life if that is what your looking for.
Horseback riding is not recommended we went and it was OK not worth the $ unless your experienced maybe.
Water sports are readily available and there was great boggie boarding the waves are big and make for a lot of fun.
Snorkeling was good not great from what my husband said.

For the Rome portion of our trip we planned to drive from Umbria, tour Rome and drive back for two days in a row.
The family had enough driving so the night before we decided to take the train in and spend the night.
We did the double-decker bus tour of Rome and halfway through the day I remembered we didn't have anywhere to stay that night.
We wanted a place by the Vatican so we could rise early and go to the Museo Vatico then go to the Basilica.
On the Bus I turned on my rented MIFI (another great decision while traveling) and found Le Suite di Via Ottaviano.
The B&B is quaint and as described more like an apartment.
It is in a residential building and some searching was needed.

Staff were ALL cordial and well trained.
I called the hotel directly & asked if they had any discounts and received a price less than on-line.
When we arrived a room wasn't available.
To compensate they upgraded our room plus paid for our late lunch in the grille.
The large umbrella in the room was an added bonus since it rained while we were there.
The water taxi was a fun touch, but was only a couple of dollars less than regular taxi.
Had a very comfortable/relaxing stay and would highly recommend BHH.

The first night I couldn't even sleep, fearing someone could come in.
The service was really bad and breakfast....
I won't even comment on that!
Searching for a cheap hotel doesn't mean having to put up with all the rudeness and the filth in there!

They just shared their travel info.
And they had great bagels and Carl's donuts, too.
We got maps for Red Rock Canyon, Ethel M Chocolate Factory, etc.
The only drawback to this place is the lack of luxury surrounding the actual resort.

Not the nearest to the airport (about 15 minutes), but shuttle every 30 minutes worrks.
That being said there is no easy way to get to the Center, even thought you are already 15 minutes closer than the airport.
A rental car is probably the best alternative.
The suites are nicly appointed, including kitchen, and relatively large.
The staff ishelpful and the included morining breakfast, although not cooked to order, is large and varied.
The two night a week "manager's reception" can be a decent dinner if one doesn't go out for something special.

It was like coming to a new place.
The we traded our week for the points in what was first Global Access and now Holiday Inn Club and have upgraded twice.
It's wonderful because now we have enough points (if we choose time and place right) to take several vacations.
We ALWAYS come to Orange Lake though each year.
The villas are nicely equipped and beautiful, the people who work at Orange Lake are fantastic, and the grounds are superb!
So anyone can see from this review that we DO LOVE Orange Lake!
We have NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever and we highly recommend Orange Lake to everybody!

This hotel looks just like the photos on their website.

This is a non-smoking hotel and does not have a casino with it, which makes it great for families.
In addition they have a nice, hot breakfast every a.m.
This hotel is about a block from the "strip", which takes about 8 minutes to get to.
The only disadvantage is that the nearest Wal-Mart that we could find was too far away for us to walk to comfortably.

The concierge were very helpful too sorting out baseball tickets for us.

A bit disappointing not to have tea making facilities in the room but not sure if this is common for New York.

I attributed that to the fact that one of the three elevators which served rooms on the lower floors was out of order.
However, it appears that this problem has persisted for some time.

Stay away from these people Our travel agent arranged our stay at Hotel de La Pace.

We had a great experience compared to the disappointing Hotel Gambrinus (see review).

Also, and this is unfortunately the reason I will probably not return, the hairdryer was painfully weak.
Normally I can dry my hair in five minutes.
It took me twenty minutes before my hair was finally dry!
Also, the $10.00 self-parking rate, we felt, was a bit too high.
Although it seems to be the norm to charge for parking at the other airport hotels in Seattle.
We got a really great rate, so I was sort of willing to excuse the problems.

What I can say is this, my family had the very best time while we stayed at the Hilton New York.
We had a 2 double bed suite on the executive floor.
We were surprised to find a Christmas tree in our room as we arrived along with ornaments and small presents for our children by the tree.
We were also welcomed by fresh cookies, milk, and Dilan's Candy bar as well.
We were called every day to see if we needed anything by the managers!
The executive lounge was busy at Christmas, but not an issue and the food was out of this world!
In closing, believe me Hilton knows how to take care of its customers.

The Flippers bar was perfect for lunch most days and pretty reasonable priced for a resort.
Lattitudes was great for dinner one night.
The shuttle boat was fine to get to Key West several times a day.
I only missed it once and had to wait a half hour to get off of the island.
The only real complaint with the resort is the exercize facility.
There is only a workout facility at the Key West hotel so you have to take the shuttle to get to it.

The price was fair for the area and te website made it appear as if I was robbing them.
Well once I got there the computer lost my reservation and I could not make out what the front desk person was saying.
I thought she said "you need to share the bathroom with the guest on your floor".
I digress, u got to my room and felt as if I was transported to the mid 1970's.
The floes and walls were dirty and falling apart, everything in the room was dated.

I was on the 11th floor and I found my room to be very quiet and clean.
The service was excellent but I would describe it as professional, rather than friendly.

The hotel was in a lovely neighborhood, very quaint, the hotel had a lot of charm.
But, the room was poor.
Maybe we just had bad luck and didn't get the 'renovated' rooms I keep reading about.
But our room was in dire need of remodeling.
There is a difference between old Amsterdam - and simply old.
This room was dusty and dirty and the bathroom was not modern at all.

Rio & Luxor were both cheaper, and we would have enjoyed them more.
The pool was terribly crowded and small, and the pool bar was expensive and awkward to get to.
Also, didn't help that our flight arrived at 8am and we weren't given a room until 5pm.
that was awful.
The service desk was rude.

If you are a golfer then you will love this property, if you want the "Hawaiian Experience" then stay elsewhere.
Overall the staff was average at best other then the front door/valet staff.
They seemed to be the only ones that cared enough to actually provide us with a Ritz Carlton sort of experience.
I would have much rather stayed in Lahaina or on the other side of the island.
The restaurants were just OK, and not worth the inflated prices, especially for breakfast.
The beach was a short walk from the property but pretty disappointing.
Most people hung around the pool which I wasn't interested in since I can do that in AZ most of the year.

It was pretty loud but the movie was almost over.

Also, to get to the room we had to go through the bar area.
It was evening, so there were people in the bar and we felt a bit uncomfortable to go through them.
However, the girl named Adel was very friendly and accommodating.

The breakfast was excelent with coffee, chocolate, tea, different natural juices, cereal, milk, muffin and scones.
The hotel was at a great location.
It was very close to the Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Boulevard.
The free Wi-Fi service was excelent and hotel parking too.
The hotel needs elevators because was very difficult to go through the stairs from the garage to the second level rooms with heavy baggages.

After waiting quite awhile, I went downstairs, and tipped the bell captain.
He immediately retrieved our new keys.
Not sure why the front desk could not have done that?
Also we were checked out a day early, and were repeatedly told how we made an error and I had to pay again with debit.
Being a frequent traveller I knew this was out of the ordinary, but pressed for time I complied.
Later that evening I spoke to another employee who was very friendly, answered all questions, and apologized for the other employee.

Firstly the free wifi was spotty and slow to the point of being unusable.
When we asked for a computer to use they directed us to one in the lobby that wasn't even on.
Lastly when trying to use one of their checkout kiosks to print boarding passes it didn't work due to lack of paper.
All of these issues could be easily fixed if the young staff would pay attention to them but they seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves.
The room otherwise was quite functional and quiet.

We were off the ship by 10 AM.
We expected a long wait for our room.
But, we were pleasantly surprised when our room was ready so early in the day!
During the post-cruise stay, we took advantage of the small laundry room in the basement.
We washed up the dirty clothes accumulated during the cruise.
So, we had all clean clothing to pack for the final journey home the next afternoon.

The entire hotel needs renovation starting with a new roof and plumbing.
It rained our second night there and we woke up with the roof leaking on our bed.
We switched to another room and the toilet leaked after every flush and flooded the bathroom.
They tried to fix it but failed so we spent the night throwing towels on the floor after every flush.
The next morning we switched rooms again.
No fridge, no microwave.
Needless to say, we will not stay here again.

They had a family-friendly DJ at the pool who ran games and played some fun music which was great.
The poolside movies (on a giant inflatable screen) were a huge hit with the kids.
The fire pits were also fun/relaxing to sit by at night (where are the s'mores Hilton???).
The room was large enough for the 4 of us and had a good sized refrigerator.
Handy because we stopped at the store for some kid drinks, snacks and wine/beer.
The only downside to the room is the lack of a balcony (there aren't any at the hotel).

Free internet was good, rooms were clean (albeit on the smaller side), and staff were ok.

Also, even though many hotels do, I don't think it's right to charge close to $20 a night for parking.

We could see the ocean from inside the condo and hear the waves crashing on the rocks at night.

Getting to your room requires first going to the third floor then transfering to another set of elevators that work with your room key.
Okay, it's nice not having the general public accessing your floor, but also a little inconvenient doing that both directions.
The rooms are nice, but not anything you can't get at Bellagio.
Like Aria you better not be shy about the bathroom since the toilet stalls have translucient doors and little privacy.
The pool is nice, but WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

Magnificent stay.
Service is incredible.
Myself and my 3 kids ages 6,8 and10 for a stay in the city for fun.
So welcoming with cider, great room on top floor, gave kids fun activity backpacks filled with fun things to do.
Great room with view of transamerica building.
Not ridiculous price for city (approx $200 a night) but add on valet parking and taxes and it was over $300.
We ordered room service for breakfast and it was delicious.

Our biggest gripe was the standard of housekeeping.
The room was not properly cleaned during the day - dirty wine glasses not washed, bottles not removed and floor not vacumed.
The coffee etc were not replenished.
On requesting an iron on the 2nd morning, it took 3 calls and 55 minutes to arrive.
Similarily, i waited 45 minutes for an adaptor plug.
The reception staff were friendly but apart from 1, they were not very helpful about places to eat in the neighbourhood.
All in all, the hotel was clean and quiet but I don't think i'd stay again.

We had a confirmed reservation for a certain type of room, which they refused to honor.
They said the would help find a similar hotel in the area, but hung up on me.
They still didn't have a problem charging me the full price of the type of room that I did reserve!
The breakfast was stale bagels and dognuts.
The room was no better than a cheap motel, with hairs left in the bathroom and a distinct odor in the rooms and the halls.
I have stayed at other Bradford's before, but have never been at one like this.
Never had such rude and un-helpfull staff before, either.

My recent stay at the Hotel Indigo was great.
As a Platinum member, I was upgraded to a very large corner suite with a fantastic view of the stadium.
The suite was located one floor above the outside open bar area, so I was concerned about noise levels late at night.
To my surprise, there were no problems with noise at all and we slept great.
The location is a short walking distance from a number of restaurants and a short walk to the trolley stop as well.
The only negatives I have are the lack of a swimming pool and expensive parking.

These reviews are entertaining.
This place really is a dump and the people that stay are comparable to the occupy wallstreet squatters.
Even the writers of these reviews seem to be riding the caboose on the train of evolution.
If you are staying there with your girlfriend she should be deformed or at least 300 pounds to fit in.
Otherwise, you will probably get harrassed.

The decor was outdated and the room had poor lighting.
Location wise it is near a highway so a bit noisy and pretty close to a fire station as I heard many sirens late at night.
It is an $80 cab ride from LAX and about $40 cab ride to downtown LA.
It is really close to Universal Studios, about a $6 cab ride.

It was our first time in Paris, and i was glad to have found this place.
It was very close to the metro, cafes, and Notre Dame.

The staff were great, even prior to getting there they answered all my questions promptly via email.
We got there super early and they were nice enough to let us check-in earlier when there was a room available.
The beds were big enough, i like the parisian bathroom, a small kitchenette, fridge, and safe.

I was on the 23rd floor and could either hear traffic and/ or the elevators going all night long.
The parking is a just plain rip off.
$42 per night for hotel guests...which is not noted on their website.
Shopping in this area is very slim, unless you like garment district type shopping.
The Macy's, a few blocks away is the worst I have ever seen.
The upside: The beds are comfortable and the linens are wonderful.
If you are an architectural type, the structure is actually amazing, when you realize the concrete construction of the building.

While the location was good, the hotel charged 2 of our families double the amount of the entire stay.
LUIS GOMEZ was the manager who was suppose to assist in fixing the charges.
It took my sister over 2 months to get the duplicate charge reversed.
6 months later, I am still fighting to remove the duplicate charge.

As for location it is about a 20 minute drive from downtown San Diego, and about 30 minutes from the Zoo and Sea World.
It is a little tough to find when you exit the highway, its kind of tucked behind an office building and a hospital.

I visit this hotel with friends and family quite often as the hotel itself is of a very high standard.
However, I have visited the day spa on numerous occasions and each time, the staff have made me feel uncomfortable.
We were left waiting at the desk for several minutes while the male staff member fiddled with his computer.
He did not welcome us or even thank us/say goodbye to us when we left.
Throughout the day, some members of the staff, in particular the gentleman, was very rude and abrupt and lacked manners and was not customer focused.
From the day I phoned to make an appointment to the actual day itself, I was given a bad vibe.
As a result, I found it very hard to relax there.

The quality of the room is good, on the small side if you are not used to staying in downtown hotels.
Plenty of room for a couple but would be a tight fit for a family of four.
Our view was of the skyscrapers surrounding the hotel since we were only on the 3rd floor.
I would request a room on a higher floor on our next visit.
We received excellent service from check-in and through out our stay.
Hotel staff were always availible to answer questions and provide great advice on sight seeing and other items.

We arrived late at night after driving for hours in the pouring rain.
The weather was unseasonably cold for our October stay.
We hadn't eaten and were directed to a family friendly restaurant on Bourbon Street, well within walking distance.
The food was excellent, but this restaurant as well as most decent ones in New Orleans were really over priced.
We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Monteleone and ate at one of Emeril's restaurants a few blocks from the hotel.
Although a nice experience, it was close to $100 for two of us and it was nothing spectacular.

To avoid the wait a little, we ordered the large drinks.

We stayed at the Adolphus with our 4 children in connecting rooms; they were the most spacious accommodations we have ever had traveling altogether!
The hotel is beautiful!!
It has a lot of old world charm and grace, and it is conveniently located downtown.
We were able to easily walk around to shops and restaurants.
We attended a family wedding at the nearby Dallas Arboretum--also gorgeous!
The only hitch was that we had to wait an hour to check in as our rooms were not ready.
That pressured us for time to get ready for the event.

The weekends seemed to get pretty booked around this time and the parking was full one night when we returned really late, like 4 am.
We had to park in a fire lane, but we left our key at the front desk and they moved it for us in the morning.
No big deal, they were great about it.
Also the pool bar was still not open as they are waiting for a licquor license.
This was not an issue for us.
We brought a cooler and stocked it with drinks and brought it down.

Stayed at this hotel as it was the host hotel for a tournament in the area.
BUT it is the host hotel for numerous tournaments in the area so if you are looking for peace and quiet... good luck.
Room was good, roomy, beds were too small, but the microwave and fridge in the room helped.
Still, a little pricey compared to other equivalent hotels in the area.
The only major complaint I would have was the customer service was really awful.
The front desk staff did not make you feel welcome and it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to answer anything or do anything.

We stayed in a King Spa Suite this time and so worth it!
The views from the room as well as the room itself was wonderful.
Everything was clean and very tastefully decorated.
The front desk staff was very accommodating with all requests.
Ate breakfast only at the restaurant and it was good and not overpriced.
The only thing is having to pay 30/night for parking.... the only thing that I'm not in love with.
If this was lowered, even by 5/night I think I would be more comfortable with paying it.

We stayed in the Silver Suites and did have the jacuzzi in our room with the curtain dividing the bathroom area.
However, the toilet and shower are both further separated individually by frosted glass doors so there is privacy.

It was close to the airport, convention center, gas light district, shopping, etc., etc., etc....
The pool area was very beautiful as well.
For the most part, the service was outstanding.
The only issue I had was with the service in the north lobby bar area.
Granted the place is swarming with conventioneers, but I was not able to get service and went completely ignored all night.
I finally bellied up to the bar.

The hotel is easy to find, head for the Cathedral towards Placa Catalyna.
Its in a great location with lots around.
The staff are very friendly and Kyle who shows you up to your rooms is a cutie!
Anyway, right outside the hotel is a cash point and its fairly easy to get access to locat transport.
You wont be able to drive to the hotel though as its pedestrianised, so if you have a car be mindful of this.
I cannot fault the hotel in anyway, bar was nice, the hotel is modern and clean.
It was a steal for the price i paid £115 a night for 2 people.

We've stayed in the Hudson for 3 nights last week.
If you're expecting an upperclass or stylish hotel you're definately gonna be disappointed.
As other reviewers already said, the lobby and bar are quite nice but as soon as you go to the room floors the image changes.
We had a deluxe double double room with 350 sq feet, so the size was quite ok, but the room was very smelly and noisy.
The carpet on the floor was all wet when we entered the room.
The ceiling was covered with yellow spots, half of the tiles in the bathroom were broken.
The safe, TV and air conditionning didn't work correctly.

I booked a superior double on their website several months ago (208 euro-quite reasonable for Paris in the summer).
It was a little larger than a standard.
The king bed is actually 2 twins pushed together.
This is Paris so the rooms are very small by American standards.
The bathroom is tiny.
I only have 2 minor complaints- neither a deal breaker.
The safe is a door in the wall about the size of a brick- large enough for passports and a money belt, operated by a key.

We ran inside to check the prices and we were shocked only 109.00 a night!
We told them 2 nights to stay and when we checked out Monday (today) they only charged us for one night!

The breakfast is typical for an Italian three star hotel.
Our only suggestion for improvement would be to have a real queen-size bed instead of two single beds pushed together.
Bottom line: we will stay here whenever we are in Florence.

We were there for 8 nights, the beds are very firm (read Hard) my husband liked this, I did not.
Not everything worked well every day.
I.e.
the jetted tub only worked two days, the shower was a little confusing.
The hotel staff was young and not all experienced so sometimes they were helpful and sometimes not.
Overall the location outweighed the problems.
We did not buy the breakfast service, there are many options very close that are better.

It is on the wall in the little area between the kitchen and main room.
Also there is a main light switch by the front door that housekeeping always turns off.
Couldn’t figure out why none of the lights would work until I flipped that main switch.
Bathroom has a big soaking tub with a separate shower.
There is kind of a funky odor that I think is coming from the bathroom vent.
You might want to bring a can of Lysol.
Turned on the Housekeeping light when I left the room about 9AM and it was always cleaned when I got back about noon.

We had two "courtyard" rooms with 3 single beds in each.
The rooms were very spacious by Mexico standards and the bathrooms were huge.
There was however no window in the room.
The rooms were at the end of the hall, beyond the courtyard, so the opaque glass block window faced a stairway and did not open.
There is no airconditioning so with no window it got a bit stuffy.
The rooms were very quiet at night however.
The third room in our group had a window on the zocalo.

Level of service is acceptable.
However the entire hotel is past its best and looking tired.
The rooms are what you would expect from a two or three stae hotel.
The hotel seems to specialise in tour parties, particularly from China.
These guests seemed to get particularly poor service from the hotel staff.
However we were our sightseeing all day so the quality of the rooms was not a major issue.
I would not recommend this hotel if you value a high quality room & high level of service.

Really nice hotel with many amenities.
The pool is beautiful and well managed - don't plan to leave your towels on loungers all day!
The staff will remove unattended Towels - which is fair for everyone.
Poolside drinks are expensive, $18 for a large margarita.
The walk to elevators from lobby is pretty long - but not unusual for Vegas, as they want you passing through the casino often.
Casino is a little smoky if you're used to non smoking environments, bout we had no issues with smoke in our room.

After complaining with staff and the manager, they didn't charge me.

I guess it was bad luck to get that room, but I had no time to change room or to complain about it....

It was by far the worst and most expensive hotel-experience we'd had in Canada.

The price is right, there are no additional charge for dogs, the location is ok.
I guess my only complaint is a very small scratch the valet put on the bumper of my car.
The valet tried to be sympathetic but didn't offer a resolution right away.
It took further questioning of the front desk to find out they had a process to resolve the matter.
They took pictures, my contact information and said I would be contacted in a matter of days.
It's been 5 days and I have not heard a word; we'll see!
For now, I give it AVERAGE!

What a charming hotel!
Our room was, like most in Paris, very tiny but it was adorable.
It was decorated with antiques and had a balcony big enough for us both to sit and enjoy a glass of wine.
We liked the neighborhood.
A bit off the tourist track but so easy to walk to the Metro that it hardly mattered.
The staff is outstanding.
They take great pride in their hotel and in pleasing their guests.

When we cam down from the great breakfast the Hotel Manager approached us and he was really sorry.
We even got 2 giftbags and the ride to the airport for free.
This is something I have never experienced before.
In contrary: other hotels don't even answer to your complaints.

We stayed here for 2 nights are part of our honeymoon in September.
Pre-arrival we had lots of contact with the hotel and they were always friendly and very helpful.
The concierge was brilliant at advising us on trips and even secured us a table at The French Laundry.
Check in was very smooth, even through we arrived early and we had a great room with views over the pool.
Breakfast was a buffet in the lobby lounge with egg and pancake stations outside.
The staff even helped us organise a mid-night snack of Dominos pizza!
A great location for exploring the wine country and centrally located to so many restaurants.

In the room, there were barely enough bathrooms to be claustrophobic.
One of the hotel staffs is not bothered by noise, so you can sleep in.
One of the rooms was relatively clean, but you couldnt get wifi in the lobby.

The actual resort was the best part of the trip.
The first day we sat at the beach bar awaiting our room and that was really the best part of the whole trip.

The pool deck is not very big but we found that with children we didn't really get to lay out much anyways.
One bad thing was that one of the pools was closed for a few hours almost everyday from either glass or debris.
We felt that glass containers should be monitored a little more closely by security or lifeguards.
This caused the other pool to be very croweded but at least there was another pool to go to.

Although we booked through priceline, they looked at various room options that would be available and gave us a bay view room in the tower.
We entered our room which looked exactly like pictures we had seen on line.
They have done renovations and everything is nice clean and newer.
We utilized the on site restaurant Acqua and bar The Olive as there are no options within walking distance due to the resort's location.
I must say that we really enjoyed lunch at Acqua including the Ahi tuna salad and fresh, warm baked bread.
We also had breakfast at Acqua and although it was pricey $36 before gratuity, it was delicious!
My husband got a wonderful crab/egg dish and I got an omlette made my way with potatoes, toast and fruit.

To be perfectly honest, I was skeptical but was pleasantly surprised.
The room was spacious, the bedding/towels were clean, and there was plenty of hot water.
Checking in and out was fast and the staff was very courteous.
There were a few minor drawbacks however.
There was no remote for the TV (not a big deal as there were only 2 channels) and the room was stifling hot.
All in all, a good place (not a 4 star hotel by any means) to stay for a few days.
As others have said, it is located a casual 5 minute walk from Times Square and the theater district.

What if a child or some one with a pace maker used it and got an electric shock, it could prove fatal.
So we wanted to know they were going to get it investigated and sorted.
We spoke to the owner whose initial repsonse was they would send the maid to test it.
When we pushed how dangerous it was and that they were risking people's lives she offered us a free night next time we came.
One of the receptionists agreed with us that it needed investigating properly but the owner refused to accept the risk.
It was only as we were leaving she said she'd send a general maintenance man to check it out, not a professional electrician.

My husband speaks French but the staff also spoke wonderful English.
The room was a good size, they give you great toiletries, and when it rained they had nice umbrellas you can use for free.
The hotel had a beautiful view of the Pantheon and the room was appealingly decorated in a very European style.
We are from NYC so perhaps our ideas of size are different from other people's, but we though the room was a very good size.
And the little balcony was nice to get some fresh air, although we didn't really spend any time on it.

Day one we were asked 6 times if we wanted free tickets to a show in exchange for a time share pitch.
This happened at Excalibur, New York, and Monte Carlo mostly.
I was the worst in the morning and they target couples.
Decent pool with newer music.
The all-day buffet was a good deal, but the food was bland.
The drink servers at both the tables and the slots did not come around often.
Expect 1 free drink every hour or two.

Restaurants were very good but can be loud in the evenings.
I also liked that all the money I spent at the hotel went against my casino rating.

Had problems on check in and check out with the foreign speaking reception staff who did not understand how to use Best Western Member cards and points.

Tips: for people staying Taxi etc can not stop on Bloomsbury St so pulled into a lane.
No car park.
If you are PD may be an issue.
Close to Tottenham Court Road tube - but Northern line is closed for pre 2012 repair and so this is crowded and chaotic at present.
The street is noisy - ask for higher floor.
There are still electrical and other issues after the refit of the building - electrical cable sticking out and inability to make direct outside phone call.

Stayed at Hotel De Carmes for 5 nights.
The rate was good and the location was excellent.
The staff spoke english well and were most helpful.
The Hotel was recently refurbished so every thing was very clean and up to date.
A couple of downsides - the rooms are quite small and it can be difficult to turn around in the bathroom.
The rooms are not air conditioned and with the weather in Europe warming up they could become an oven.

The pool area is fun for the kids with nice places to eat on site.
If you want to go off site, there are plenty of places within a 5 min drive.
Advice: ask for a fridge in the room.
The mini bar is too small if you have kids.
Bring your own float for the lazy river like @pjw08 suggested.
A few days before arriving, call Marriott Rewards and ask for the "taste of Gold" if your are not a Gold level rewards member.

We even had left my sons shark tooth necklace behind and they kindly returned it after finding it.
BUT the reason for my not so stellar review is one of the beds were not changed because we found another persons bodily hair all over it.
Although they responded immediately and changed it the damage was done not to mention the beds were unforgiving, difficult to sleep in..
The bathroom had hair in crevices...it was dirty!
The air conditioner was EXTREMELY loud.
The Continental Breakfast was NOT the norm in other Hampton Inn locations.

The bathroom was bigger than expected, and was clean and tidy.
We were expecting it to be way out of the way, but were pleasantly surprised at its central location.
Was only a few blocks away from Times Square and Subway stations to get you to the rest of Manhattan.
The pool was great, with some nice views of the skyline from the 10th floor.
Didn't use the restaurant as we read some reviews here and decided to experience as much of New York as possible.
The diner down the road (Citylights Diner) was absolutely the best place for breakfast.

No big deal, but this is not what I expected from a 5+ star resort.

Getting to the hotel from Tegel Airport was an adventure, though.

It would be very helpful if the hotel website gave specific instructions when using the buses.

However, they are in need of updating - bedspreads, marble in bath, fixtures, etc.

Great Location We just returned from a week stay at the Ohana East.
It was not what one may come to expect at Hilton or Marriott, but it was not bad.
In fact the room kind of grew on us.
We were located on the fourth floor at the end of the hall and noise was not a factor at all.
We had a king bed with a sofa upgrade.
The major complaint we had was the shower was extremely small.

We stayed here for 4 nights to start off our honeymoon and had a great experience at this hotel.
We stayed in a 'Sultan's Room' and it was decent sized (for European standards).
It was clean, nicely decorated, had a nice bathroom, and even a little balcony.
The hotel is in a prime location, as pretty much all of Sultanahmet was walkable.
They have the most amazing views from the rooftop terrace.
We really enjoyed the breakfast was served on the rooftop every morning.
However, probably the best part of this hotel is the staff (especially Erehon and Ece?).

My only complaint is that the back conference rooms are a dead zone for internet.

The service was fine and the food was worth the price.
The thing is because we didnt book with Expedia hotels.ca or orbitz, we did not have to pay commission.
Hotels are forced to keep the rate high when their is a third party.

The price was really good.
And the hotel was a perfect 5/5.

Go expecting to lose and if you win its a bonus.
The older and smaller hotels seem to pay out more often but in smaller amounts.
However, I saw a lady put in a dollar and win $5000.00.

I have come to a conclusion that the room really doesn't matter much when I go on holidays because we spend so little time in them.

The recently redecorated Le Parc Trocadero is lovely.
Small attractive interior bar with beautiful, outside oasis setup with conversation areas for cocktails.
The redecorated hotel is warm and inviting.
Hotels rooms are pricey for their size so having the French courtyard was welcomed.
Our room was so small that there was one way traffic in front of the bed!

We had an early flight the next day from LAX.

I am from Iowa City and have probably booked 70 nights of rooms there (two rooms at a time) over the past eight years.
WE LOVE IT and wouldn't stay anywhere else.
It is what New Orleans is about.
There isn't a more pleasant staff to work with, the location is everything and the courtyards are beautiful.
We always spring for a courtyard room but if money is an issue than get an interior room and walk out to enjoy the patio area.
I only wish they employed a frequent user punch card in order to get some comps once in awhile!!!!
Book freely and without hesitation and no I do not work there!

Listen if I had more money I would try another hotel like the Bellagio or Wynn.
But I picked here for the $40 a nt rate (using the Mcard for Feb7-10).
Yes like everyone else I hate the resort fee (all the MGM properties charge it).
The hotel does have flaws, I too had a room that had both chairs with stains and a stain on the carpet.

They have they're own SUV, and they arranged to take us to a happening restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal.
It's pretty pricey....at $500 a night for an almost basic room, but well worth it.
I recommend you bring your own wine, munchies, and water....because the fully stocked fridge is so over priced.
The hotel itself has a really great sit down bar, and a yummy restaurant attached from the outside.

This hotel offers a swimmingpool, sauna and steamroom.
Many times we couldn't use it because all space was reserverd for a private party!
No nice relaxation after a long day walking and shopping in NY.
Breakfast was very nice, but there's hardly any space to sit!
You have to wait long time for a table, of take a plate and take your breakfast to your room of sit by the pool!

The location is excellent.
No worries about getting anywhere - you can walk.
The hotel is filled with history and has the ambience you want in a city like New Orleans.
The room was wonderfully decorated and the price we paid per night was excellent - much lower than the advertised rate.
So I'd suggest calling and talking to them personally to see what can be done.
I don't know what kind of accommodations they have that would be suitable for children.
The bar in the hotel has lots of history, too, and it revolves.

No big - we weren't there to hang out in the halls.
Key West was not that good - I'd recommend only for snacks and drinks, not for an actual meal.
Whatever you do, don't ask the hotel to call a cab for you.
They call a car service that charges more than double what the city taxis charge.
We were appalled.
And don't make any long distance phone calls - $22/minute.

The rate was $500 a night and was NO WHERE NEAR worth that amount.
I have stayed in $500 hotels before and this IS NOT one of the, .
The rooms were quite small, had mold on the bathroom ceilings and were not "plush" in my opinion.
There is a hotel bar and restaurant downstairs and a GREAT, AFFORDABLE deli directly across the street for breakfast.
I cannot remember the name, but it is not Lendi's.

I stayed here in July 2010 with friends.
Front Desk - Nice staff and very helpful.
However the concierge was useless.
They sent us to the wrong area twice and even to a museum thats closed for the next 2 years and has been closed for a year.
We thought it was closed but they said it wasn't, so we went against our judgement.
Secondly we asked for a market to go to and were sent to the North of Paris.
To those from outside Paris the north is not really a place you should go.

And we found a Target and Publix where we bought our steaks to cook, very convenient.
On the topic of food, the free breakfast at the hotel was great too.
They alternated everyday.
scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, waffles are just some of your options.
The oatmeal was also memorable - creamy and warm.
Bananas and some canned fruit are other options.

Everyone we met was extremely friendly and more than willing to offer tips on good restaurants, shopping, entertainment, and most importantly, directions!
Our rooms were clean and comfortable.
If I had to offer any kind of critique, its that I wish the room would have had a mini-bar.
Plus there were no vending machines.
But it did have a little fridge and so we were able to stock up on drinks and snacks from a nearby CVS.
The location was great and within walking distance of just about anything you could need.
And if you wanted to take the subway (the "T"), the entrance was a couple of blocks away.

Maximum stay is 5 hours each day.
We usually drop the kids 1 or 2 hours, so I can grab a drink at the bar with my husband.
So while the kids can have fun, we get to relax on our own.

We found the food to be very good whether eating at one of the buffets or the smaller restaurants in the Paris.
The rooms (we upgraded to a Red Room) were very nice with better than average furniture and furnishings.

The check-in could be more efficient.
Waited in a long line and the room wasn't ready.
After coming back to get the room and waited in a longer line, we got our room.
The room was on the 5th floor which probably was (or still is) a smokers floor.
We were in the shoebox room for 30 minutes and my wife had to call to change rooms.

Plus the hotel restaurant is more than a hotel restaurant, it is a very good one - hotel or not.
Rooms are good, cleaning was excellent .The hotel also has a special treat.
At five every afternoon the let you taste local wines in the lobby.
Which also means you get to chat with other guests, share experiences etc.
You also get free coffee in the mornings.
The downside was a very unsecured supply of hot water.
More than one I had to take a cold shower - not very nice in November.

Club Room was not really worth the extra.
Little things were missing such as the complimentary newspaper and footstools for the furniture - things which are used to sell these rooms.
Breakfast was a rather tired affair with little room to sit and, when the croissants ran out, they stayed run out!
Rather a pain, too, not to be able to reach the Club lounge from my room without going down to the lobby and taking another lift.
Despite what another reviewer said, the in room bar is not complimentary.
I checked!
On the plus side, the hotel managed to accommodate me for an early check-in.

Since it rained during our stay, the walkways were wet.
I've never stayed at a four/five star hotel where some of the rooms are outside.
But, they were still nice.
Florence is a bit dirty and of course an old city.
The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is an overpriced and overcrowded tourist trap.
We quite enjoyed the Uffizi Gallery and seeing the David.
A half-day trip to Pisa was fun with my children.

Enjoying Time Square at Christmas is simply amazing.
Every staff member at this hotel went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was a great one.
This hotel is beautiful and the Living Room Bar was such a comfy place to have a drink with new friends.
I cannot say enough about how polite and professional everyone was at this place.

We did change rooms as the first was small.
I had booked a deluxe and I didn't feel this room was.
It was no problem they gave us drinks whilst we waited.

The place was renovated 2 years ago, yet some of the room details could have been paid closer attention to.
The caulking around the shower for instance, was sloppy and some of the tile work crooked.
Holes patched were obvious as well.
The rooms are quite comfortable and well appointed.
Although the walls are very thin and you may easily hear the snorer next door.
Aside from those minor annoyances, the hotel shines.
The lobby has comfortable seating areas and gives a hacienda feel.

We had a very spacious, clean room and paid only $40 per night!
This is an amazing deal!
Furthermore, we ate at the "Top of the world restaurant" which was an amazing experience!!
We loved, loved the view over the whole city and the food was great!
The service was brilliant and the staff very friendly!!
If you stay at the Stratosphere don't miss the restaurant and the bar on top of the tower!
Try to make reservations, it can get really crowded, especially on the weekends.

Excellent location, couldn't be bettered.
Room was fine, very clean and well furnished, cleaned every day of our stay.
Staff were helpful and most spoke English.
Noisy, but that is to be expected in any hotel especially in a 24hr city like Barcelona.
Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and always fresh.
I would recommend this hotel if you're not looking for 5 star, but want somewhere central, clean and good value.

The hotel staff were extremely friendly and knowledgable.

Although the restaurant was expensive, we bit the bullet and ate there 2x and were not sorry we did.
My kids found the memorabilia scattered throughout the hotel fun and we were able to enjoy the pool at night after the parks.
We had rented a car thinking we would go off site to eat and do other things, but found we did not need to at all.
Citywalk provided us all the fun and shopping we needed.

I went to the hotel office but it was locked and there was no one there.
I had to wait until someone showed up at 9 a.m. for them to change my room.
Upon check out, I asked for a receipt.
I noticed at the airport that MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S ROOM AND SERVICES.
I called the hotel and the woman at the front desk was extremely rude about the situation and could not comprehend the problem.
I had to start a dispute through my credit card company, so we'll see how that pans out.
The beds are extremely uncomfortable.
