Are you a graduate student baffled by the many possible NLP careers that lie in front of you? Perhaps you are an advisor who wants to help their students navigate the modern NLP world? Or maybe you’re just curious about the options? 

Following last year’s well received “Careers in Industry” panel at NAACL in New Orleans, NAACL-HLT 2019 will feature a similarly themed panel discussion on Careers in NLP. To keep the panel discussion relevant and interesting to the audience, we would like to invite you to fill out [a survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAANAAYLQFrZUM0hRWUlPMzhKMUJRVlRRNFozN0ZOOE1OMS4u). Please use this survey to share the questions and topics you would like to have included in the panel discussion. 

Stay tuned for more information about the panel and the list of panelists.
