<i> Live tweeting ACL 2020 // Author Option to Opt-Out </i>

<h2>Call for Volunteers</h2>

We are seeking volunteers to live tweet/live microblog ACL 2020 presentations with the goal of raising the visibility of ACL 2020 talks, across platforms and across languages. Specifically, we envision live microblogging of pre-recorded presentations (between when they become available and the end of the conference) and the live plenary sessions. Recognizing that bilingual live microblogging (listening in one language, writing in another) is a more difficult task, we nonetheless hope that the pre-recorded format might make it possible. By coordinating community live microblogging, we hope to increase coverage of ACL 2020 talks, as was done for NAACL 2019. We are particularly excited about the prospect of multilingual live microblogging to broaden participation in ACL and our associated community.

If you are interested in participating, please email [ACL2020publicity@uw.edu](ACL2020publicity@uw.edu) by <b>June 26</b>, with the following information:
- The language(s) you’d like to microblog in
- The platform(s) you’d like to use
- The [ACL 2020 areas](https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/#submissions) you are interested in microblogging about

Never tried live microblogging before? That’s fine! We plan to run a brief tutorial ahead of the conference, following [this guide developed by Rachael Tatman](http://www.rctatman.com/Livetweeting-Guide/).

<h2>Author Option to Opt-Out</h2>

If, for any reason, an ACL 2020 author would prefer not to have their presentation live microblogged, we ask you to contact us with that information and the paper title at [ACL2020publicity@uw.edu](ACL2020publicity@uw.edu) by June 29. We will ask our ACL 2020 live microbloggers to not cover your presentation.
