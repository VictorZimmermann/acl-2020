**May 29, 2020**. The virtual ACL 2020 is an opportunity to connect participants across the world. The ACL 2020 Diversity & Inclusion committee is soliciting applications with the goal of supporting prospective conference attendees who are facing financial difficulties and would like to participate in ACL 2020. Through this effort, we hope to broaden participation of researchers, especially researchers who are underrepresented in our community. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=y3NlOXjzaEubyBV1XAxR8-nGpYowZ2VHg83e19kLLsdUNFpGNzZVWEZMMktFMVM5T1FIVDZZT0k4US4u) by June 7. Decisions will be sent out by June 19th, in advance of the early registration deadline. We thank the ACL 2020 sponsors, particularly the Diversity & Inclusion sponsors, for their support. If you have any questions, please email [acl2020-diversity-inclusion-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl2020-diversity-inclusion-chairs@googlegroups.com).

**April 4.**<br/>
Dear ACL2020 Community,<br/><br/> 
We hope you and your families are safe and well.<br/>
We can now confirm that in response to COVID-19 we will be holding ACL2020 online, on the same July 5-10 dates.<br/>
We know that many in our community are suffering or may suffer great hardships from this pandemic. We hope that we can work together in this difficult time to build a new kind of ACL meeting this year, one that offers more sustainability, expanded opportunities for exchange of knowledge, and increased inclusion of diverse contributions from around the globe.<br/>
We will have pre-recorded talks and the full set of tutorials and workshops, and will be planning various live events like Q&A sessions, mentoring, job fairs, and spaces for hallway conversations. This will be challenging but also an opportunity for coming together virtually, and I'm looking forward to working with the entire ACL2020 organizing committee to host an enlightening and meaningful conference. <br/>
In the near term we are getting advice from other online conference chairs (who have already been enormously helpful), and we will be drawing on all the lessons from our online teaching now and in the past. I've been impressed by the resilience, passion, and positive spirit of everyone I see in all our newly online classes and meetings, and the matching spirit of the whole ACL community. I am grateful to be able to work with you all to make ACL2020 happen for all of us! <br/>
We'll be posting more details on registration in the next few weeks and more on the mechanics of the virtual conference soon.<br/><br/>
With warmest wishes for everyone's health,<br/>
Dan Jurafsky, General Chair, for the whole ACL2020 Organizing Committee

**March 12, 2020**. <br/>
ACL2020 Community, <br/>
We wanted to let everyone know our plans with regard to COVID-19. While we are looking into all possible options (including an all-virtual conference) we think by far the most likely scenario for ACL2020 is that we will have our regular live conference in July as usual.  We do expect somewhat smaller attendance, and plan to offer increased availability of remote presentations to accommodate the members of our community whose ability to travel or get visas is impacted. We'll also be planning for ways to keep everyone healthy at the conference itself. Meanwhile we'll be tracking the situation carefully, and will keep you in the loop as we know more. Stay healthy everyone! <br/>
Dan Jurafsky, General Chair, for the whole ACL2020 team
