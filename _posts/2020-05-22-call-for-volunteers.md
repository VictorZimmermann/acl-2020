Dear ACL members,

As most of you may know, ACL is going virtual this year. With the conference just about a month way, we are looking for volunteers to help us out with some web development associated with the virtual conference website. We are seeking <b>8-10 volunteers</b> who are well-versed in one or more of the following: <b>CSS/JS, Python/Flask, Apache/NGINX, and GitHub CI and Actions</b>.

Our plan is to adapt [Mini-Conf](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf) that was recently used to host [ICLR2020](https://iclr.cc/). But we really need your help to get there! As a volunteer, you will be contributing to specific projects under this effort. You can find some initial projects under the ACL2020 virtual conference [GitHub repository](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-2020-virtual-conference/projects).

If you are interested in helping out with this effort, please reach out to us directly via email ([acl2020-virtual-infrastructure-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl2020-virtual-infrastructure-chairs@googlegroups.com)). 

We look forward to your help.

Thanks<br/>
ACL2020 Virtual Infrastructure Team
