## About Minneapolis

Minneapolis is considered to be one of the safest big cities in the country. Ease of transportation, pedestrian and bike friendly access is abundant, and with over 40,000 people living downtown, that is a natural vibrancy within the city throughout regardless of time of year. 
 
That said, as with anywhere you travel, being aware of your surroundings and not being careless with your belongings is suggested. In June, there is typically a baseball game or Minnesota Lynx (WNBA) game taking place in the evening in the warehouse district and most shopping/restaurants are open and active well into the evening. It stays light out until about 9:00pm at that time of year with dusk lasting until near 9:30/10:00pm. 

Whether you want to check out nearby Minneapolis entertainment districts or explore fun things to do in the Twin Cities, our convenient location on Nicollet Mall puts you in the heart of it all. Located steps from Target Center, Target Field, and the new US Bank Stadium, we make it easy to see a variety of professional sporting events, including the Vikings, Twins, Timberwolves, and Lynx. While relaxing at the hotel, you can take a refreshing swim in the indoor heated pool or workout in the 32,000 sq. ft. StayFit™ Gym, open 24-hours a day.

You can find various local attractions [here](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/minnesota/hyatt-regency-minneapolis/msprm/area-attractions) to occupy your free time.


## Social Event

The NAACL 2019 Social Event will be held on Tuesday, June 4th, from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm at [The Minneapolis Institute of Art](https://new.artsmia.org/about/).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/Mia-exterior-1200x800.jpg" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Inspiring wonder through the power of art. The Minneapolis Institute of Art enriches the community by collecting, preserving, and making accessible outstanding works of art from the world’s diverse cultures." %}

Join us for a cultural event at the Minneapolis Institute of Art and enjoy gallery-themed food and drinks, numerous galleries which include African, Asian, and European, plus the traveling Hearts of Our People  presented in close cooperation with top Native women artists and scholars. This first major exhibition of artwork by Native women celebrates the achievements of over 115 artists from the United States and Canada spanning over 1,000 years. And, of course, music!

One entrance ticket will be included with registration but please note that space is limited to the first 1700 participants.  We are expecting a very large conference, so it is important to let us know on the registration form whether or not you plan to attend the social event.

To get to the event, catch the shuttle bus outside of the Hyatt Regency (the conference hotel) between 6:45 pm and 7:15 pm.

## Transportation

There is light rail service from both airport terminals to within a few blocks of the conference hotel, for $2 each way.  Tickets are purchased from vending machines at the stations, and trains run every 10 minutes from 6am-7:30pm, and then 3-4 times an hour 7:30pm to midnight.

Specifically, you want the BLUE line Northbound toward downtown (the other direction will take you to the Mall of America).  Take it to the Nicollet Mall Station stop (30min ride), which is at 5th & Nicollet. From there, you can walk the half mile along Nicollet to the hotel (12th & Nicollet), or take any of the 10,11,17 or 18 bus lines (the 10 and 18 are free along this route).

## Accommodation

We have secured accommodation for participants at NAACL-HLT 2019 discounted rates at the Hyatt Regency Minneapolis which is also the conference venue.  You can learn more about the hotel [here](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/minnesota/hyatt-regency-minneapolis/msprm).

- Located 12 miles from MSP International Airport.
- Complimentary Wi-fi in all guest rooms.
- Single/Double Room: **$199**, Triple Room: **$224**, Quad Room: **$249**.

Quoted rates will be possible up to 3 days pre- and post-conference, based on hotel availability.  ACL discounted rates are available through Saturday, May 11, 2019. Reservation requests received after the cut-off date will be based on standard room type availability at the contracted group rate.

The rooms may be reserved online [here](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/group-booking/MSPRM/G-CMPL).

### Students

We have also booked a small number of rooms specifically for students at the [Doubletree Suites by Hilton Minneapolis](https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-hotel-minneapolis-MSPLSDT/index.html) at the super-discounted rates of **$119** per night (1-2 people), **$139** (3 people) and **$159** (4 people). We strongly encourage students to share rooms to the extent possible.

The ACL Office will accept your reservation request and make the reservations on your behalf. Room sharing is recommended since only a limited number of rooms are available at the discounted rates. If you would like to share, you will need to specify the total number of people who will be sharing the room including yourself (i.e., yourself plus 1 to 3 others). Please be aware that rooms typically come with two beds so any more than two people may have to share a bed.

We will do our best to honor your request on a first-come first-served basis. All requests must be received no later than Wednesday, May 1, 2019 by the ACL Office.
