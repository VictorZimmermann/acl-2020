The ACL 2020 registration fees are drastically reduced, reflecting our necessary move to being 100% virtual.  We are offering Early rates through June 26th and Late rates beginning June 27th.  We include early and late rates to encourage early registrations so we can approximate the numbers of users and be able to work around any potential for system crashes or other glitches due to unexpected high volume.  The fees charged will allow full access to all parts of the conference.

## Registration Details

<b>Early registration</b> ends June 26, 2020, 11:59 PM (EDT) with Regular at $125 and Student at $50.

<b>Late registration</b> begins June 27, 2020 and remains open throughout the conference, with Regular at $175 and Student at $75

## ACL Membership

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2020) ACL member.  So, in addition to the above registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2020 paid member.  Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again.  Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Contact Details

## Virtual Conference Cancellation Policy

For cancellations received up to two weeks prior to the conference,  registration fees will be reimbursed;  ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) is not reimbursable.
