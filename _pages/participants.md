## Diversity & Inclusion Plans

The virtual ACL 2020 is an opportunity to connect participants across the world. The ACL 2020 Diversity & Inclusion committee is soliciting applications with the goal of supporting prospective conference attendees who are facing financial difficulties and would like to participate in ACL 2020. Through this effort, we hope to broaden participation of researchers, especially researchers who are underrepresented in our community. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=y3NlOXjzaEubyBV1XAxR8-nGpYowZ2VHg83e19kLLsdUNFpGNzZVWEZMMktFMVM5T1FIVDZZT0k4US4u) by June 7. Decisions will be sent out by June 15th, more than a week in advance of the early registration deadline. We thank the ACL 2020 sponsors, particularly the Diversity & Inclusion sponsors, for their support. If you have any questions, please email [acl2020-diversity-inclusion-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl2020-diversity-inclusion-chairs@googlegroups.com).
