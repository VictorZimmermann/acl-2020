<b>Tutorial Chairs (Agata Savary and Yue Zhang) and General Chair (Dan Jurafsky), for the entire Organizing Committee</b>

ACL 2020 features 8 tutorials on July 5. See the [schedule](https://acl2020.org/program/tutorials/) and our [previous post](https://acl2020.org/blog/intro-to-tutorial-infrastructure/) for the introduction to the tutorial organisation and infrastructure.

Here we give some further details of the tutorial modalities. Different modalities apply to different tutorials in three stages: <b>before, during</b> and <b>after</b> the tutorial. Please, read them carefully before attending. Recall that a registration is compulsory to attend any ACL 2020 event.

Tutorial materials are available <b>in advance</b> on the virtual conference website (from <b>July 3</b>). For some tutorials - T1, T3 and T5 - 
it is necessary to <b>watch the pre-recordings in advance</b>, since the live sessions will only feature question answering. 
For other tutorials, pre-recordings or pdf slides are also available and it is recommended (even if not compulsory) to watch them and <b>prepare questions</b>, 
which you can ask on the RocketChat channel of each individual tutorial.

The modalities of the <b>live sessions</b> greatly differ from one tutorial to another. Please check all the details in the table below. 

<b>Disclaimer</b>: Last-minute changes might apply. For the latest updates, please, watch the webpages of the tutorials you wish to attend.
