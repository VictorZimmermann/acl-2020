## About Minneapolis

Minneapolis is considered to be one of the safest big cities in the country. Ease of transportation, pedestrian and bike friendly access is abundant, and with over 40,000 people living downtown, that is a natural vibrancy within the city throughout regardless of time of year. 
 
That said, as with anywhere you travel, being aware of your surroundings and not being careless with your belongings is suggested. In June, there is typically a baseball game or Minnesota Lynx (WNBA) game taking place in the evening in the warehouse district and most shopping/restaurants are open and active well into the evening. It stays light out until about 9:00pm at that time of year with dusk lasting until near 9:30/10:00pm. 

Whether you want to check out nearby Minneapolis entertainment districts or explore fun things to do in the Twin Cities, our convenient location on Nicollet Mall puts you in the heart of it all. Located steps from Target Center, Target Field, and the new US Bank Stadium, we make it easy to see a variety of professional sporting events, including the Vikings, Twins, Timberwolves, and Lynx. While relaxing at the hotel, you can take a refreshing swim in the indoor heated pool or workout in the 32,000 sq. ft. StayFit™ Gym, open 24-hours a day.

You can find various local attractions [here](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/minnesota/hyatt-regency-minneapolis/msprm/area-attractions) to occupy your free time.

## Transportation

There is light rail service from both airport terminals to within a few blocks of the conference hotel, for $2 each way.  Tickets are purchased from vending machines at the stations, and trains run every 10 minutes from 6am-7:30pm, and then 3-4 times an hour 7:30pm to midnight.

Specifically, you want the BLUE line Northbound toward downtown (the other direction will take you to the Mall of America).  Take it to the Nicollet Mall Station stop (30min ride), which is at 5th & Nicollet. From there, you can walk the half mile along Nicollet to the hotel (12th & Nicollet), or take any of the 10,11,17 or 18 bus lines (the 10 and 18 are free along this route).

## Accommodation
