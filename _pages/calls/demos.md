<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Call For System Demonstrations</span>

The system demonstration track at NAACL-HLT 2019 is a venue for papers describing system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Publicly available open-source or open-access systems are of special interest.

All accepted demos are published in a companion volume of the conference proceedings. We expect at least one of the authors  to present a live demo during a demo session at NAACL 2019, with an accompanying poster. 

This year, we will also present a Best Demo Paper Award. The winner will be chosen based on the contribution and completeness of the system, as assessed by reviewers and also based on the live demo at the conference. 

Submissions will undergo a single-blind reviewing process. So papers may include author and affiliation information, and freely make references to previously published material, and URLs.

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions should be made electronically via [START](https://www.softconf.com/naacl2019/demos/). Submissions must include:

- A paper describing the motivation and technical details of the system, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). See examples of recent accepted demo papers in NAACL 2018, ACL 2018, ACL 2017, EMNLP 2017, NAACL 2016, ACL 2015, NAACL 2015.

    - The papers must be no more than four pages, with unlimited pages for references. Please use the main NAACL 2019 paper style files ([LaTeX](http://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-latex.zip), [Word](http://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-word.zip), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-naacl-hlt-2019-proceedings/xyyfwfkswhth)). Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content so that reviewersâ€™ comments can be taken into account. 

    - Any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines and page limits will be automatically rejected. 

- A short (max. 3 minutes) video demonstrating the system. This video will be used to evaluate the paper, but won't be published unless requested. 

    - A [screencast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast) with audio narration is a natural choice for demos which can be presented on a screen. Otherwise, a video of a user interacting with the system can be used (see [this video](https://sounding-board.github.io/demo.html) demonstrating the sounding board system as an example).

    - The production quality of the video is not of interest. Hence, we encourage the videos to be simply a screencast of the software that is getting demoed, with zero to minimal editing efforts. 

    - We recommend that you publish your video to YouTube or another website and include the link in your paper. If you prefer not to publicly upload a screencast, please submit the video (in MPEG4 format). The video must be included as supplementary material when you submit your paper through SoftConf. 

In addition, we highly recommend that you also include a link to a website that hosts or demonstrates your system in the paper draft. However, we understand that this may not be possible for certain types of services or products.




## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing will be single-blind, so you need not anonymize your paper and all the urls mentioned in it. Relevant papers that meet formatting requirements will be assessed on the basis of their relevance to the demo track, contribution, clarity, completeness and novelty. Submissions of identical or closely related work to multiple tracks at NAACL 2019 (comprising research, industry, demo) will be rejected by all tracks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I submit to industry track or to the system demonstration track?**

The NAACL 2019 industry track will feature papers related to challenges of real-world implementations of systems. Papers for the industry track also span a broad range of topics related to system implementation such as datasets, evaluation, scalability, and ethical issues.  While demo papers can also involve these aspects, the focus is on a system that can be demonstrated to perform some task, analysis, or programming support. It is possible that the descriptions of some systems could be suitable for both the industry and demo tracks. Then the choice has to be made by the authors about the focus of the paper, and track participation. If the aim is to describe the system and its features, demo track may be more appropriate. If it is to discuss the challenges related to real-world application and deployment, then the industry track is suitable. Feel free to also read the FAQs on the industry track CFP page. Please do not submit the same work to both tracks.

**Why is a video mandatory and how will it get reviewed?**

The video of your demonstration is intended to aid reviewers in making a decision. The use is primarily to judge the completeness of the system and put a face on the described system. This will give the reviewers a better idea about the system features and characteristics, which can result in a more fair judgement. 

Reviewers will be instructed that the interface quality is not the only aspect to consider in the video. Furthermore, the production quality of the video itself will not be a criterion in the reviewing process.

**What technical support will be provided in the demo session?**

The organizers will provide a monitor, internet access, and electric outlets. International visitors may need to bring an adaptor (details on the voltage range and plug type used in the US can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country)). Most demos are presented using a laptop, but some demos may use different types of computers (e.g., smartphones or embedded systems). Unfortunately, the organizers will not be able to provide laptops.
