Now that ACL 2020 will be entirely virtual, we are revisiting what sort of registration we will have and will post updates soon.  We hope to open registration by sometime around the end of April to mid-May. Please watch here for further updates.

## Cancellation Policy

- Anyone cancelling their registration one month or more prior to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid.

- Anyone cancelling up to three weeks prior to the conference will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.

- Anyone cancelling within three weeks prior to the conference and all no-shows will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration).

- Anyone cancelling due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office.
