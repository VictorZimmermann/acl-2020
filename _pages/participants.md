## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will it be possible to attend the conference in person?

As of yet the format of the conference has not been decided. Of our four scenarios, three would feature some kind of in-person events to varying degrees. For more information on our covid preparedness, check our [Coronavirus pages](https://69.stuts.de/covid).

### Participation fee

There will be one fee to attend the joint conference, so there is no need to sign up individually. The fee will depend on the format and number of sponsors, but in the case of in-person events we will base it on previous Stuts iterations.
