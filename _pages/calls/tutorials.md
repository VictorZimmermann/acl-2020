<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Joint Call for Tutorial Proposals: ACL/EMNLP-IJCNLP/NAACL 2019</span>

The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing & International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), and the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) invite proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with ACL 2019, NAACL 2019, or EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval and multimodal processing. 

This year, we invite proposals for two types of tutorials: (a) cutting-edge and (b) introductory:

1. **Cutting-edge**: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP-IJCNLP/NAACL related tutorial.

2. **Introductory**: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., bioinformatics, social media, human language processing, machine learning techniques).

Tutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues:

- [ACL 2019](http://www.acl2019.org/): The 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics will be held in Florence, Italy, July 28&ndash;August 2, 2019. The ACL tutorials will be held on July 28, 2019.

- [NAACL HLT 2019](http://naacl2019.org): The 17th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 2&ndash;June 7, 2019. The NAACL tutorials will be held on June 2, 2019.

- EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 (the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing &  International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing 2019) will be held in will be held in Asia World Expo, Hong Kong, November 3&ndash;November 7, 2019. Exact tutorial dates will be announced soon.

## Remuneration

Information on the payment for tutorial instructors can be found in the [Tutorial Teacher Payment Policy](http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Tutorial_teacher_payment_policy).

*Please note: remuneration for tutorial presenters is fixed according to the above policy and does not cover registration fees for the main conference.*

## Diversity and Inclusion

As we recognize the current problems of demographic imbalance in the field, we particularly encourage submissions from members of under-represented groups in computational linguistics.
 
## Submission 

Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents and should contain the following:

- A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the computational linguistics community (no more than 2 pages).
- Type of the tutorial: introductory vs. cutting-edge
- A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the core content can be covered in a three-hour slot. In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are available as well. These time limits do not include coffee breaks, e.g., a three-hour tutorial in fact occupies a 3.5-hour slot, and a six-hour tutorial occupies a 7-hour slot.
- Breadth: include an estimate of what % of the tutorial covers work by the tutorial presenters vs. work by other researchers. We ask for at least 50% other people’s work, in order to avoid having tutorials that are “self-invited talks”.
- Specification of any prerequisites for the attendees. Here are some examples:
    + Math: e.g., “Understand derivatives and integrals as found in introductory Calculus” 
    + Linguistics: e.g., “Be able to parse and generate text with Context Free Grammars” 
    + Machine Learning: e.g., “Understand ‘classical’ supervised methods such as decision trees and Naive Bayes” 
    + Other areas: e.g., “Familiarity with WordNet”
    + Programming or other tools: e.g., “Knowledge of Python and Unix command line tools” 
    + Small reading list, e.g., list of three papers not by the tutorial presenters
- The names, affiliations, email addresses and websites of the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.
- An estimate of the audience size for the tutorial. If the same or a similar tutorial has been given before, include a note specifying where previous versions of the tutorial were given, how many attendees were at the main venue, and how many attendees the tutorial attracted.
- A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., Internet access).
- A note specifying which venue(s) (ACL/NAACL/EMNLP-IJCNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable. Please include a description of any constraints that might make the tutorial compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically, or otherwise.

Tutorial proposals for ACL/NAACL/EMNLP-IJCNLP should be submitted online using the [START system](https://www.softconf.com/i/acl-tutorials2019/). Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the Tutorial Co-Chairs of the three conferences.


## Tutorial Instructor Responsibilities

Accepted tutorial presenters will be notified by February 1, 2019. They must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference registration material by the specific conference deadlines. The description should be in two formats: (a) an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and published on the conference website, and (b) a PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed instructions will be provided). Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials by the deadlines specified for the three conferences (TBD), with **course slides submitted at least one month prior to the date of the tutorial**. The final submitted tutorial materials must minimally include copies of the course slides and a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial.
