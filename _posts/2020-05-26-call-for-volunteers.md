<b>Submission Deadline: Friday, <strike>June 9</strike> June 12, 2020</b>

NOTE: Those who already volunteered following our earlier call for website development volunteers, can we trouble you to please fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefcn0Evb_K-NTT62c1yty_3v0XddvafZT_UYP47GsC2sFFnA/viewform?usp=sf_link) or [this Microsoft Office form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WY4w_ivCkJNKnHxP2pxjk6pUNlNUMFdSUUtSQ0haRVlYVDFEQTcxWEEzRC4u) (incase the Google form is not accessible) so we can ensure you get free registration.

<h2>VOLUNTEER/SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</h2>

We seek student and non-student volunteers for the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2020). In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and ACL membership.  Non-student volunteers also receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials). 

As ACL 2020 will be virtual, volunteer tasks will be different from previous years. We are seeking volunteers to help us in the follwing tasks:
- develop the virtual conference website (using CSS/JS, Python/Flask, Apache/NGINX, and GitHub CI and Actions), 
- organize video presentations, 
- act as technical host for live video Q&A sessions, and 
- provide assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops (including the student research workshop). 

As we will receive most of the presentations prior to the conference, a large portion of the tasks will be done in advance, maximizing volunteer access to the conference events.  

<h2>SELECTION CRITERIA</h2>

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). <br/>
Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper in the main conference, the Student Research Workshop, or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of support.

<h2>SUBMISSION PROCEDURE</h2>

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program should fill <b>one of the application forms</b> below (not both):
- [Google application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefcn0Evb_K-NTT62c1yty_3v0XddvafZT_UYP47GsC2sFFnA/viewform?usp=sf_link) OR
