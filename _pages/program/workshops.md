## Two Day Workshops

### IWSLT 
The 17th International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) is an annual scientific conference for the study, development and evaluation of spoken language translation technology: speech-to-text, speech-to-speech translation, simultaneous and consecutive translation, speech dubbing, cross-lingual communication including all multimodal, emotional, para-linguistic, and stylistic aspects and their applications in the field. The conference organizes evaluations and workshop sessions around challenge areas, and presents scientific work and system descriptions. <br/>
