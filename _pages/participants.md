## Frequently Asked Questions

### Obtain the certificate of attendance

For certificates of attendance, paid-in-full invoices (to use as receipts), and related documents required by your home institutions, please contact [Pat Kirby](mailto:acl.PatKirby@gmail.com). For other more general information, please contact [Priscilla Rasmusse](mailto:acl.rasmussen@gmail.com).

### Trouble logging in to the virtual website
If you have registered for ACL2020, please wait till end of July 3rd for your welcome email which will contain your username and password to access the virtual site. Only then you can access the virtual website by following the [login instructions](https://acl2020.org/_pages/docs/ACL2020_virtual_website_login_steps.pdf). 

<!--### What is the recommended way of using this site and navigating the conference?

All of ACL 2020 will be accessed through the main webpage. You can access all parts of the conference using the top menu bar. Check the Schedule to know when the live sessions for speakers Q&A and posters are taking place. You can navigate all the papers in the Papers section: you can search for keywords and authors, looking through all papers by skimming titles, or using the visualization tab at the top. We encourage everyone to visit the sponsor section and then to participate in as many socials and using the chat tool. If you need any help you can ask one of the on-call helpers on the #helpdesk channel in RocketChat.

### How can I best plan my time and engage with the conference?

You should explore the papers using the Schedule or Papers tab. We think the easiest approach is to create a set of bookmarks of the webpages for papers you want to watch the video of and discuss live during one of the sessions. Another option is the simple text file: create a document consisting of links, organized under the dates and times.

### How can I best engage from my timezone?

Participants and authors are spread out across the world. This is by far the trickiest aspect for virtual ACL. Most of us are not used to navigating across timezones. The calendar displayed on the website is shown in your local time, and the Google Calendar with all the events is public and can be copied to your personal calendar. For more information about the live Q&A sessions timetable please check the ACL virtual infrastructure details.

Here are some hypothetical interactions from hypothetical people across timezones:

On Day 1, April 27, all videos for that day are released at the start of the day (GMT+12). This includes the pre-recorded PC welcome, two invited talks and the 5 or 15-minute videos for the papers in the poster sessions for that day.

A participant Maryam from Syndey (GMT+11) decides she would like to join two poster sessions, one at 5 am GMT and one at 8 am GMT (4 pm and 7 pm her time). Earlier in the day, at 10 am, she starts by watching both invited talks and posting questions on RocketChat. At noon, she visits a few booths: one on a discussion about optimization, and another for AwesomeCo since she is interested in an internship. At 4 pm, she joins the 2h poster session, browsing posters and joining the Zoom link for posters to listen & ask questions. InvitedSpeaker1 lives in Kenya and has a live Q&A at 5 pm Kenyan-time (2 pm GMT). Invited Speaker2 lives in NYC and has a live Q&A at 3 pm his time (7 pm GMT). These happen while Maryam is sleeping, she will watch these recorded Q&A on April 28.

Meanwhile, Marek from Lagos is waking up (GMT+1). He has planned to join the live Q&A for both speakers, and the poster session at 12 GMT (1 pm his time). Then he is going to go to a social being held on RL in the evening, at 5 pm. He starts the day, at 9 am, by watching the first invited talk, and writing down a few questions. He then watches a 1-hour oral/spotlight session on RL, with two 15-minute orals and several spotlights. He finds this by clicking on the sessions, which can be watched at anytime that day. He joins the live Q&A with InvitedSpeaker1, at 3 pm, and Raises his Hand on Zoom to ask a question (and is then called on to ask, with his audio unmuted). He then watches the second invited talk, and Thumbs Ups a question that was asked by another participant on RocketChat. That live Q&A happens at 8 pm, but he cannot join in the evening. He watches the recorded Q&A the next day, and the question he upvoted was asked and answered.

Linli from Seattle is waking up. They marked 10 papers they would really like to investigate deeply. They start by watching all the videos for those papers (9 of them have 5-minute videos, 1 is an oral that is 15 minutes). They also watch three other videos from the set of papers recommended for them. They join two poster sessions, at 5 pm GMT and 8 pm GMT (10 am and 1 pm their time). Fortunately, 8 of the 13 papers they watched videos for are in these poster sessions, and they can chat with the authors. They know the live Q&As happen at 2 pm and 7 pm GMT, which is 7 am and noon in their time. They decided to watch both videos the day before (on Monday), and post a question on RocketChat about each. They tune in to the second live Q&A, at noon right after the first poster session they attended and right before the second one.

Throughout, participants have discussions (asynchronously) on RocketChat and can post written questions for the authors on the channel for their paper. Authors pop in and write answers to questions for their paper.

### What if I have a problem?

If you have any technical difficulties, please contact #helpdesk. If you have a problem with inappropriate conduct, please see the below about Accessibility and Safety.

### What parts of ACL are live?

The Poster Sessions, Q&A with Invited Speakers, Keynote Presentations, Award Sessions, Business Meetings and Sponsors Booth are live. These live sessions occur at specific times, so make sure you look at the Calendar to see what is live right now (see Schedule in menu). You can also use this Calendar to add sessions that you are interested in, to your own personal calendar. For more information about the live sessions timetable please check the [ACL virtual infrastructure details](https://acl2020.org/blog/intro-to-conference-infrastructure/).

### How do I talk to an author at a poster?

Each paper will appear in two different poster sessions. Each paper has two associated Zoom links, one for each poster session. You can only talk to the authors during these live poster sessions. On the page for that paper, you can click the Zoom link for the currently active poster session, and you will join the Zoom session. Please `Raise Your Handâ€™ to indicate that you would like to ask the author questions. This will put you in a queue, so that the author can keep track of who wants to ask a question next. We also recommend that you watch the video for the poster first, which replaces the typical poster spiel. We want to remind you to be respectful during these conversations and follow the ACL Code of Conduct.

### When I join a Zoom link for a poster, I am put into a waiting room instead of joining. What is wrong?

If an author does not show up for their poster video session, then there is no host for the Zoom link. All non-author participants are put in the waiting room until one of the authors opens the 'start' link. If this happens, please notify #helpdesk.

### How do I ask questions of the invited speakers, offline before their live Q&A?

Each invited speaker has a RocketChat channel. Questions for the invited speaker can be posted there. Other participants that are also interested in the question can Thumbs Up the post, to increase the visibility of particular questions.

### Can I ask questions of the invited speakers live on Zoom?

The live Q&As will allow for 300 participants. The Zoom webinar allows for questions to be typed. In most cases, especially if there are many questions, the session chair will simply read out the question, for simplicity. However, this is up to the session chair, and in some cases they will allow you to ask a question.

### How do you ensure safe online engagement?

All participants are bound and expected to uphold the conferenceâ€™s Code of Conduct. We have taken several steps to safeguard against 'Zoom Bombing' by changing the permissions, types of calls we use, and having moderators with ability to evict participants, amongst others. For text chat, the authors, Workshop organisers, or Social organisers are leaders of their chat and can take steps to prevent trolling, and ensure meaningful conversation. Individual chat entries can be reported as well within the RocketChat tool.

### How do I report disrespectful engagement, trolling, or other breaches of the code of conduct?

ACL2020 adheres to the ACL Code of Conduct. Any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the ACL Executive Committee. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

### Which countries is ACL accessible from?

We have selected technologies we rely on to run the fully virtual ACL carefully in order to maximize its reachability. More specifically, we have used our large pool of volunteers from all over the world to check the accessibility of all four services, including Zoom, Slideslive, RocketChat and ACL Web Portal. From these tests, we have confirmed that these services largely work from any country across the globe, but as we are too well aware, the service status in each country may change overnight. If you have having difficulty accessing any of these services, please report it to us at #helpdesk channel.

### General data protection

This site records a very limited amount of data. Data as text in RocketChat is accessible only to registered conference attendees and will be removed two weeks after the conference. Zoom sessions for Poster Sessions and Virtual Socials will not be recorded (other than Q&A sessions with keynote speakers). Videos are hosted by our video partner SlidesLive; more details on Licensing is available from SlidesLive.


### What do I need to know to present my poster?

As an author on the paper, you will be a host on the Zoom link. When you join, it will start the meeting and it will allow others to join. Please join the link 5 minutes early, to be ready to start the session on time. We ask that you pay attention to Raised Hands, and try to discuss with people in the order that they raised their hand. This way they have a rough estimate of how long they might have to wait, and makes for respectful interaction. If someone is monopolizing your time, and you notice many hands are raised, do feel free to say â€˜Unfortunately, I have to give some of the other participants an opportunity to ask questions as wellâ€™.

As a host, you have additional privileges. If someone is being disruptive, or not muting themselves when needed, you can mute them. If someone is being inappropriate and violating the Code of Conduct, you can eject them from the meeting. If you would like to make an author a co-host, you can do so. Additionally, only hosts can share their screens. You might find it useful to simply keep your screen shared the entire time, so that you can refer to figures in your slides.

### What is ACL doing to mitigate Zoom bombing?

All conference content is restricted to conference attendees are not meant to be shared. We have changed all the defaults for Zoom to prevent disruption to video sessions. This involves changing several settings for greater control, including host-only screen sharing, disabling joining a session before a host, disabling file transfer, and disallowing removed participants to rejoin a video call. Also see answer to question on `How do you ensure safe online engagement?â€™


### What happens to the recorded talks and Q&A sessions after the conference?

All talk recordings will be made publicly viewable at the ACL Anthology after the conference.

### Where can I obtain the certificate of attendance?

For certificates of attendance, paid-in-full invoices (to use as receipts), and related documents required by your home institutions, please contact Pat Kirby. For other more general information, please contact Priscilla Rasmusse.

### Other Questions?

Contact the volunteers on the #helpdesk channel on RocketChat


## ACL Code of Conduct 

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated on-line discussions. This includes: speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it through ensuring that all are welcome to participate in shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any current member of the ACL Executive Committee or contact Priscilla Rasmussen, who is usually available at the registration desk during ACL conferences. Members of the executive committee will be instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.

Implementation
This policy should be posted prominently on all ACL conference and workshop webpages, with a notice of a list of people who can be contacted by community members with concerns or complaints, which will be forwarded to the Professional Conduct Committee for investigation.
