We’re bracing for what will likely be the largest NAACL-HLT conference given our current submission numbers. This trend of course is not new: NAACL, EMNLP and ACL, all had a record number of submissions and participants in 2018. As we continue with the organization and planning of this year’s NAACL, we are wondering what the community feels about these ever growing numbers, and we are brainstorming ways to minimize the impact a larger-than-usual conference attendance has on the overall conference experience.
