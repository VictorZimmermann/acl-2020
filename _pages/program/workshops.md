More details for the workshops will be added as they become available. 

### SemEval
[The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2019/) is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems; it evolved from the Senseval word sense evaluation series. The evaluations are intended to explore the nature of meaning in language.<br/>
*Organizers: Jonathan May, Ekaterina Shutova, Aurelie Herbelot, Xiaodan Zhu, Marianna Apidianaki, and Saif M. Mohammad*

### *SEM
The [8th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics](https://sites.google.com/view/starsem2018) brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages and its computational modelling. The conference embraces symbolic and probabilistic approaches, and everything in between; theoretical contributions as well as practical applications are welcome in the form of long and short papers.<br/> 
*Organizers: Marine Carpuat, Sebastian Padó, and Rada Mihalcea*

### Clinical NLP
[The Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://clinical-nlp.github.io/2019/) specifically focuses on advancing state-of-the-art in clinical NLP, rather than merely applying existing NLP systems to downstream clinical problems (such as outcome prediction or clinical cohort selection).<br/>
*Organizers: Anna Rumshisky, Kirk Roberts, Steven Bethard, and Tristan Naumann*

### LaTECH-ClFl
The [3rd Joint SIGHUM Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature](https://sighum.wordpress.com/events/latech-clfl-2019/) will put in the same room two events with a similar research focus and with some tradition: the Workshops on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities (LaTeCH) and the Workshops on Computational Linguistics for Literature (CLfL). The LaTeCH workshop series has focused on developing technologies for improved information access to data from the humanities and social sciences and the CLfL workshops have focussed on applications of NLP to literary data.<br/>
*Organizers: Beatrice Alex, Stefania Degaetano-Ortlieb, Anna Kazantseva, Nils Reiter, and Stan Szpakowicz* 

### ESSP
The [Workshop on Extracting Structured Knowledge from Scientific Publications](https://scientific-knowledge.github.io) focuses on processing scientific articles and creating structured repositories such as knowledge graphs for finding new information and making scientific discoveries. The aim of this workshop is to identify the necessary representations for facilitating automated reasoning over scientific information, and to bring together experts in natural language processing and information extraction with scientists from other domains (e.g. material sciences, biomedical research) who want to leverage the vast amount of information stored in scientific publications.<br/>
*Organizers: Vivi Nastase, Benjamin Roth, Laura Dietz, and Andrew McCallum*

### SLPAT
The [Workshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies](http://www.slpat.org) bring individuals from the areas of Assistive Technologies/Augmentative and Alternative Communication and Speech/NLP together with users to share research findings, and to discuss present and future challenges and the potential for collaboration and progress.<br/>
*Organizers: Heidi Christensen, Kristy Hollingshead, Emily Prud'hommeaux, Frank Rudzicz, and Keith Vertanen*

### DISRPT
The [Workshop on Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking](https://sites.google.com/view/disrpt2019/) aims to broaden the scope of discussion from previous biennial events on discourse relation studies. The goal is to include participants and program committee members from different discourse theories (especially, but not limited to, RST, SDRT and PDTB) and focus on applied papers with a computational orientation, resource papers and work on discourse parsing, as well as papers that advance the field with novel theoretical contributions and promote cross-framework fertilization.<br/>
*Organizers: Amir Zeldes, Debopam Das, Erick Galani Maziero, Juliano Antonio, and Mikel Iruskieta*

### CMCL
The [Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics](https://cmclorg.github.io/) The CMCL workshop provides a venue for computational research on cognitive theories of language processing, representation and acquisition.<br/>
*Organizers: Emmanuele Chersoni, Cassandra L. Jacobs, Alessandro Lenci, Tal Linzen, Laurent Prévot, and Enrico Santus*

### CLPsych
The [6th Annual Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology Workshop](http://clpsych.org/) aims to bring together computational linguistics researchers with clinicians to talk about the ways that language technology can be used to improve mental and neurological health.<br/>
*Organizers: Kate Niederhoffer, Kate Loveys, Philip Resnik, Rebecca Resnik, and Kristy Hollingshead*

### SPNLP
The [3rd Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP](http://structuredprediction.github.io/SPNLP19) aims to bring together NLP and ML researchers who have an interest in structured prediction due to recent advances in methods using continuous representations, being able to learn with task-level supervision, or modelling latent linguistic structure.<br/>
*Organizers: André F. T. Martins, Andreas Vlachos, Sujith Ravi, Zornitsa Kozareva, Julia Kreutzer, Vlad Niculae, and Gerasimos Lampouras*

### NeuralGen
The [Workshop on Methods for Optimizing and Evaluating Neural Language Generation](https://neuralgen2019.github.io) aims to discuss new methods for language generation that address some of the recurring problems in existing language generation techniques (eg. bland, repetitive language) as well as novel techniques for robustly evaluating and interpreting model output.<br/>
*Organizers: Antoine Bosselut, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Srinivasan Iyer, Urvashi Khandelwal, Hannah Rashkin, and Asli Celikyilmaz*

### WASSA
The [10th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis](https://wt-public.emm4u.eu/wassa2018/index.htm) aims to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text.<br/>
*Organizers: Alexandra Balahur, Roman Klinger, Veronique Hoste, Carlo Strapparava, and Orphee De Clercq*

### VarDial 6
The [6th Workshop on NLP for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects](https://sites.google.com/view/vardial2019) is the latest in a well-established series of workshops promoting a forum for scholars working on a range of topics related to the study of diatopic linguistic variation from a computational perspective.<br/>
