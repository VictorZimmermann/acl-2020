This year, in addition to the usual sponsors, we have a new sponsorship intiative designed to help the ACL community make our conferences more accessible and inclusive to every researcher working in our domain.  The **Diversity &amp; Inclusion** category is designed to address three main axes through sponsorship:

- **Parental inclusion and childcare**: ACL wants to become more family friendly and inclusive of researchers in our community who would have difficulty in attending the conference without some additional support.
- **Disability access**: The physical environment of ACL conferences should encourage all attendees.  Therefore, the ACL would like to extend special support to participants whose access to integral parts of the conference would be compromised due to poor disability access.
- **Low-income support**: Students and researchers at institutions with access to fewer resources are often prevented from attending ACL conferences.  ACL would like to offer financial support to help as many of these students and researchers as possible to attend the conference in person.

Sponsors in this category contribute at two levels: Ally and Champion. 

We gratefully acknowledge support provided by all of the following for the NAACL 2019 conference.
