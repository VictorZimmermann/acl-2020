In preparation for the next phase of the review process, we’re requesting the community to volunteer as emergency reviewers. These short-turn-around reviewers are almost always needed in conferences as there are always last minute changes in availability of reviewers for many reasons (health, unexpected changes in workload) and, let’s face it, Murphy’s Law as well. We want to have a list of go-to backup reviewers for these cases. Please consider [volunteering](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1LjaTCcEgVONMC-e-WvB03dSH0m4ewPSvxJxu_do-RrRl9Q/viewform) to help us out!

If you’re already a reviewer but can manage a higher workload than the papers already assigned to you, please also fill out [the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1LjaTCcEgVONMC-e-WvB03dSH0m4ewPSvxJxu_do-RrRl9Q/viewform) to indicate your availability.
