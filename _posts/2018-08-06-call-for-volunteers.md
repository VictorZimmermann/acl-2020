If recent trends are any indication, the research track of NAACL-HLT 2019 is going to receive an impressive number of submissions. We want to make sure that all these submissions receive the attention of qualified reviewers and area chairs, and in order to make that happen we need your help!
If you imagined the existence of a master list of all qualified reviewers and area chairs that we could access...well, so did we. :) It turns out there is no such list, and so each conference cobbles together a list of reviewers and area chairs from previous events. It's a surprisingly messy process where it is easy enough to overlook willing and qualified folks who would do a great job serving in these roles but who don't get asked. That's surely not our goal. 

So, if you feel like you would be a good reviewer or area chair for the research track of NAACL-HLT 2019, please volunteer by filling out this [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/Ap1nlNKhF1E88Kv72)! And if you know someone who you think would do a great job, please volunteer them as well! Please give us as much information as you can about yourself or whoever you are volunteering, since we will do a little screening to make sure we have a qualified reviewer pool. Also, if you volunteer someone to be a reviewer, they will of course be able to opt-out if they'd prefer not to be involved. Finally, your responses will not be shared outside of the program co-chairs, so the fact that you volunteered or volunteered someone else will remain private. 

Thank you!

<span style="font-size: smaller;">PS: NAACL-HLT 2019 takes place June 2-7, 2019 in Minneapolis. While deadlines haven't been set yet, it's likely that most reviewing and area chair work will take place in the range January - March 2019.</span>
